The tv personality announced the news while going about his daily co-hosting duties on the "Today Show."</p><p class=dh>When he told his co-hosts the big news, they all got up to hug him, but Carson argued that it's Siri they should be hugging as he'd "done very little in this situation."</p><p class=dh>Siri shared the news via Instagram along with a sweet picture of her children's little hands pressing against her sizeable tummy. In the caption, she noted that she always wanted a big family.</p><p class=dh>She joked that her son, now 10, would be the one raising their newest kid as he is the eldest.
