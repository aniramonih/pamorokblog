The Live With Kelly and Ryan co-host is known for putting her husband, Mark Consuelos, and three kids, Michael, Lola, and Joaquin, first, so it's no surprise that there have been questions about her own extended family since she's such a cool mom and wife. So with that said, we're looking into whether or not she's close with her mother and father, and if she has any siblings.</p><p>Here's everything we know about Kelly's family.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Who are Kelly Ripa's mother and father?</h2><p>If you watch Live!, you've probably heard Kelly gush over her parents at some point. Her mother is Esther Ripa. She was born on June 23, 1941. Her father, Joseph Ripa, who was born on July 3, 1939, is still working hard today despite also being in his early 80s.</p><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">CamdenCounty.com</a>, Joseph — <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">who appears on</a> Kelly's current show <a href=#>Generation Gap</a> — serves as the Camden County Clerk for Camden, NJ, with his term having begun in January 2020 and not ending until December 2024.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/media.distractify.com/brand-img/KnO_D1y2A/200x200/headshot-1564501435809.PNG><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>His bio on the page explains that he graduated from Camden High School in 1957 and then attended Rutgers University. He also served in the U.S. Army. He's been the County Clerk in Camden since 2009 after holding many other positions in the county, including Vice President of Central Labor and Freeholder.</p><p>Kelly's parents currently reside in Voorhees Township, which is not too far from NYC where Kelly lives. Including Kelly's kids, Esther and Joseph are grandparents to six grandchildren.</p><p>Kelly has proved time and time again that she has a strong bond with her folks. She has posted a number of sweet photos of her parents over the years, from throwbacks to more recent pics.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>"Happy 60th anniversary to Joe and Essie Ripa, aka Dad and Mom!

And this morning I see that my mom was sporting the chicest French girl bob I've ever seen."</p><p>"She goes, 'Ugh, I didn't want to deal with it.
