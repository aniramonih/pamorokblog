Who he is is not a mystery, but what is always happening between them is.&nbsp;</p><p>Sometimes, it appears like Glaser herself is confused. However, in her moments of certainty, the comedian confirms that her heart beats for a confident man.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite several ups and downs, she said it had done so for nine years. The name of Nikki Glaser’s boyfriend is Chris Convy, and here is what we know about him.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/nikki-fotor-20230818155545-819x1024.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_Is_Nikki_Glasers_Boyfriend></span>Who Is Nikki Glaser’s Boyfriend?&nbsp;<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Glaser first met her boyfriend, Chris Convy, when she co-hosted the late-night talk show “Nikki and Sara” with Sara Schaefer.&nbsp;The two subsequently started dating and enriching each other. Convy, who is a writer and producer, has been very supportive of Glaser’s work.&nbsp;</p><p>She once admitted: “He is such a fantastic person to work with, and he has made my show so great.”</p><p>Unfortunately, in 2016, the pair split. The comedian later confessed that she had grown tired of trying to please Convy by pretending to be someone else.&nbsp;Rather than cry or get distressed about the split, Glaser turned it into material for her comedy. Convy became a significant topic for Glaser’s show.&nbsp;</p><p>She once joked: “I just went through a breakup, so I have a lot of new material about that because it just happened. I also have a lot of material about my dog.”</p><p>Their separation was not permanent because when Glaser became the host of the reality show “FBoy Island” in 2022, she revealed she and Convy had been dating intermittently for eight years.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/glas-683x1024.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=How_Is_Nikki_Glaser_and_Chris_Convys_Relationship></span>How Is Nikki Glaser and Chris Convy’s Relationship?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Things seemed to improve after Glaser took their relationship live for her reality show, “Welcome Home Nikki Glaser?” The show followed Glaser’s life following her decision to move back to her place of birth, St. Louis, Missouri, during the COVID-19 pandemic.&nbsp;</p><p>She confessed: “My experience on ‘FBOY Island’ definitely did make me think about relationships and dating (…) and look back on something that I had before that just didn’t work out because of things that I thought were deal breakers back then. I was willing to try again.”</p><p>Glaser spent time with those important to her, including her parents and best friend, Kerstin Robinson.&nbsp;The scare of the pandemic also added another layer of commitment to what she shares with Convy.</p><p>He also moved back to St. Louis (his hometown) like Glaser.&nbsp;The smitten man even requested that Glaser be his emergency contact number — a step forward from casual dating.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Is_Chris_Convy_Still_Nikki_Glasers_Boyfriend></span>Is Chris Convy Still Nikki Glaser’s Boyfriend?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>As of early 2023, Convy and Glaser are reportedly cozy again. The pair attended the 28th Annual Critics Choice Awards on January 15, so things seem to be going well.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Nikki-Glaser-1024x652.jpg><p>They don’t seem to be in a rush to get married, and the comedian allegedly has no plans for children in her future. Glaser once spoke about “freezing her eggs” to delay the decision to have children.&nbsp;</p><p>She <a href=#>said</a>: “I’ve never really wanted kids. I’ve always said it’s not for me, but I always reserved the right to change my mind about that. I know certain things happen. You meet a certain someone, and you’re like, ‘I need to have a baby with this person.'”</p><p>This is not to say Glaser is ruling out marriage or having a family with Convy; it just means she is focused on her legacy of making people happy.&nbsp;The talented comedian has confessed that she broke Convy’s trust and that they would need to build it back for progress in their relationship.&nbsp;</p><p>Will that progress involve wedding bells and diapers in the future? That remains to be seen. However, one thing is sure, Glaser and Convy seem to be better together than apart.&nbsp;</p><p>Fans hope that the pair will stop the back and forth and finally decide to settle down. However, since it is a union they hope will last forever, they don’t mind giving Convy and Glaser time to be sure before they leap into marriage.&nbsp;</p><p>There is also a chance that the pair will end up dating forever but never getting married. Celebrity couples known for that include <a href=#>Goldie Hawn and Kurt Russell</a> and Maya Rudolph and Paul Thomas Anderson.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmajBp7HSrWWcp51kuqax02aloqObnnqouMCsnKurXZe8urLRopynnF2ptaa10WajqK6VYrmqssRmop6doKh6tbTEoqlmnpGjwG6z1J6qrKGenHw%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fmeet-nikki-glasers-boyfriend-their-love-life-keeps-their-fans-guessing.html&text=Meet%20Nikki%20Glaser%27s%20Boyfriend%3a%20Their%20Love%20Life%20Keeps%20Their%20Fans%20Guessing&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmeet-nikki-glasers-boyfriend-their-love-life-keeps-their-fans-guessing.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmeet-nikki-glasers-boyfriend-their-love-life-keeps-their-fans-guessing.html&title=Meet%20Nikki%20Glaser%27s%20Boyfriend%3a%20Their%20Love%20Life%20Keeps%20Their%20Fans%20Guessing" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fmeet-nikki-glasers-boyfriend-their-love-life-keeps-their-fans-guessing.html&title=Meet%20Nikki%20Glaser%27s%20Boyfriend%3a%20Their%20Love%20Life%20Keeps%20Their%20Fans%20Guessing" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fmeet-nikki-glasers-boyfriend-their-love-life-keeps-their-fans-guessing.html&title=Meet%20Nikki%20Glaser%27s%20Boyfriend%3a%20Their%20Love%20Life%20Keeps%20Their%20Fans%20Guessing" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmeet-nikki-glasers-boyfriend-their-love-life-keeps-their-fans-guessing.html&description=Meet%20Nikki%20Glaser%27s%20Boyfriend%3a%20Their%20Love%20Life%20Keeps%20Their%20Fans%20Guessing" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./166005-us-most-beautiful-women-meet-miss-usa-co-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Meet the Miss USA Contestants from Each State">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./mattie-westbrouck.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Mattie Westbrouck Height, Weight, Age, Girlfriend, Facts, Biography">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
