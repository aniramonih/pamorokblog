To date, she has played in over 15+ movies and 15+ T.V. series such as&nbsp;<i>Flesh, Perfect Stranger</i>, and&nbsp;<i>Law & Order</i>.</p><p>The popular actress, Patti, was born on&nbsp;<i>25 May 1951</i>&nbsp;in Manhattan, New York City, the USA. Likewise, she was born under the zodiac sign, Gemini, and she belongs to the white ethnic background. Her nationality is American, and she is married thrice in her lifetime. Let's take sneak peek in her marriages and husbands.</p><h2>What Is Her Current Marital Status?</h2><p>Well, the 68 years old actress, Patti, is a single woman as of 2020. After her third divorce, she remained single until now as she is not seen with any other men since then. Arbanville is currently enjoying her single life and living a low-key profiled life.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2020/1/9/1208426_200723816779401_307338953_n-1578568665217.jpg><p>Besides dating and relationships, she loves to enjoy her leisure time hanging out and partying with her friends. It has been 18 years that she is single, but there is no sign of her being mingled for now. The last time that she uploaded a picture with her friends, <strong>Susan Patricola</strong> and <strong>Emmelyn Quinn</strong>, on <i>10 December 2013</i>, when they were attending the premiere of American hustle.</p><h2>Married Thrice Until Now</h2><p>Even though she is single as of 2020, she had been in a couple of married life. Initially, she wedded <strong>Roger Miremont</strong>, a well-known French actor from Bordeaux. The two tied the knot on <i>1 August 1975</i> in a small wedding ceremony. However, they decided to part ways in 1980 and separated.</p><p>During her marital life with Roger, she learned French, and now she is a professional French speaker. Then, she tied the knot with <strong>Steve Curry</strong> on <i>26 April 1980</i>. Unfortunately, her second marriage also turns out to be a failure as they divorced after a year of exchanging wedding vows.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2020/1/9/280full%20(1)-1578568763572.jpg><p>After 11 years and finally, she exchanged wedding vows on <i>15 June 1993</i> with <strong>Terry Quinn</strong>. Terry worked as a firefighter at that time. The pair stayed together until 2002 and but parted their ways on <i>12 March 2002.</i></p><h2>Three Children From Her Third Marriage</h2><p>She does not share children with her first and second husband but shares three children with her third husband, Terry Quinn. She became a mother for the first time in <i>October 1990</i> when she gave birth to her eldest daughter, <strong>Emmelyn Quinn</strong>, who is <i>29</i> years old as of <i>2020</i>.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2020/1/9/Capture%20(2)-1578568903421.PNG><p>After a year of Emmelyn's birth, she gave birth to her second daughter, whose name is <strong>Alexandra Quinn </strong>(1991), and she is currently 28 years old. At last, then a couple, Terry and Patti, welcomed their youngest child, a son in 1992, and his name is <strong>Liam Quinn</strong>.</p><h2>Relation With Don Johnson&nbsp;</h2><p>As a matter of fact, she shares a son with <strong>Don Johnson</strong>, who is widely recognized as an actor, producer, director, singer, and songwriter. Even though the two shared a child, but they were never married. Well, the two lived together from <i>1981</i> to <i>1985</i>. Then a couple, Patti and Don met at an L.A. Restaurant and hooked up that night.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2020/1/9/2edf3a08f596536b7d00e26e184020c5%20(1)-1578568984796.jpg><p>After a month, she knew that she was pregnant, and they even decided to marry. However, she declines to marry Don as they didn.t get along. Their son's name is <a href=#><strong>Jesse Johnson</strong></a>, who was born on <i>7 December 1982</i> and currently aged 37.</p><p>As of now, Jesse is an actor by profession and played several roles in various genre films and series such as <i>Word of Honor, Prey, Circle of Eight</i>, and many more.&nbsp;</p><h2>Past Affairs Of Patti D' Arbanville</h2><p>Besides her three marriages and relation with Don, Patti was romantically involved with other men in her past. In the late 1960s, she was romantically involved with a singer and songwriter, <strong>Cat Stevens</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>At that time, she was a model, and during their relation, she became the inspiration for Cat for his two hit songs, "<i>Lady D' Arbanville</i>" and "<i>Wild World</i>." In an interview, she said that she heard the song and commented this,</p><p>"Lady D'Arbanville" when I left for New York. I went for a month, and it wasn't the end of the world, was it? But he wrote this whole song about "Lady D'Arbanville, why do you sleep so still." It's about me dead. So while I was in New York, for him, it was like I was lying in a coffin... He wrote that because he missed me because he was down... It's a sad song."</p><p>These are all the known relationships and marriage details of her life.</p><h2>Patti D' Arbanville's Net Worth</h2><p>As an actress, she has accumulated a hefty amount of money from her career, Patti's net worth is estimated at around <strong>$2 Million </strong>as of 2020 which is similar to <a href=#><strong>Nia Renee Hill</strong></a>. To date, she has appeared in over 20+ movies and 20+ T.V. series. Without a doubt, she earned all of her fortunes by playing these movies and series.&nbsp;</p><p>Besides, she might be earning through endorsements deals and commercials as well. According to Work Chron, the average wage of an actress is around <strong>$39.84</strong> per hour as of 2020. So, she might be getting around the average salary for her appearance in films and series.</p><p>Apart from her earnings and fortune, her ex-boyfriend's net worth is mind-boggling. Don Johnson's net worth is around <strong>$40 Million</strong>, and Cat Stevens' luck is approximately <strong>$20 Million</strong> as of 2020.&nbsp;</p><h2>As An Actress</h2><p>She kicked off her professional career as an actress by playing the film named <i>Flesh </i>in 1968 as Patti. However, the first film that she ever played was in 1960 when she was just eight years old. Since <i>Flesh</i>, she continuously appeared in several films.</p><p>Some of the films that she played are <i>The House (1970), Wired (1989), A Tale of Two Pizzas (2003), Perfect Stranger (2007)</i>, and <i>The Extra Man</i> (2010). Similarly, she has also appeared in several T.V. series such as <i>Once An Eagle, Murder, She Wrote</i>, and <i>Crime Story</i>.
