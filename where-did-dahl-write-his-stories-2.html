His service in <b>the RAF</b> influenced his first story collection, Over to You: Ten Stories of Flyers and Flying (1946), a series of military tales that was warmly received by critics but did not sell well.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=did-roald-dahl-write-his-own-books></span>Did Roald Dahl write his own books?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Who Was Roald Dahl? Roald Dahl was a British author who <b>penned 19 children’s books</b> over his decades-long writing career. In 1953 he published the best-selling story collection Someone Like You and married actress Patricia Neal. He published the popular book James and the Giant Peach in 1961.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=why-did-roald-dahl-write-the-book-matilda></span>Why did Roald Dahl write the book Matilda?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Roald Dahl <b>Wanted His Magical ‘Matilda’ To Keep Books Alive</b> For many young readers, Dahl is a beloved author. But to Lucy Dahl, he’s also Dad. “Matilda was one of the most difficult books for him to write,” she says.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=why-did-roald-dahl-write></span>Why did Roald Dahl write?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><b>Roald Dahl was inspired by his own children</b>, and he routinely made up stories for them at bedtime. These stories often turned into his published books. For instance, his first book, James and the Giant Peach, began as a bedtime story. Family has always had a big effect on Dahl’s writing.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-was-the-first-childrens-book-roald-dahl-wrote></span>What was the first children’s book Roald Dahl wrote?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>The Gremlins Roald Dahl was 27 years old when he wrote his first children’s book, which was called <b>The Gremlins</b>.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-much-money-did-roald-dahl-make></span>How much money did Roald Dahl make?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Roald Dahl was a British novelist, poet, screenwriter, and fighter pilot who had a <b>net worth of $20 million</b> at the time of his death.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-many-words-did-roald-dahl-invent></span>How many words did Roald Dahl invent?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>500 words Roald Dahl invented <b>over 500 words</b> and character names, from the famous Oompa-Loompas and whizzpopping to lesser-known Dahlisms like humplecrimp, lixivate, sogmire and zoonk, but this is the first time many of them have featured in a dictionary.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=who-wrote-matilda></span>Who wrote Matilda?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Roald Dahl Matilda/Authors Matilda is a book by <b>British writer Roald Dahl</b>. It was published in 1988 by Jonathan Cape in London, with 232 pages and illustrations by Quentin Blake.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-many-books-did-roald-dahl-wrote-altogether></span>How many books did Roald Dahl wrote altogether?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><b>49</b> – the total number of books published by Roald Dahl, including collections and books published after his death, but not including screenplays and plays.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-did-the-bfg-call-a-fart></span>What did the BFG call a fart?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>In Giant Land, a fart is <b>a whizzpopper</b>. Now that The BFG is on the big screen, it’s likely the word “whizzpopper” will be creeping into the vocabularies of kids everywhere. The Giant’s word for a fart is only one element of author Roald Dahl’s made-up language, Gobblefunk.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=is-there-a-day-dedicated-to-roald-dahl></span>Is there a day dedicated to Roald Dahl?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><b>September 13</b> is Roald Dahl Day, a holiday dedicated to one of the world’s greatest storytellers.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=why-did-roald-dahl-made-up-words></span>Why did Roald Dahl made up words?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>In an article on the OED website, Susan Rennie, editor of the Roald Dahl dictionary, wrote: “Dahl built <b>his new words from the building blocks of the old, using established patterns of word formation and sound symbolism</b>, so children and grown-ups alike can make sense of it, even when seeing the words for the first time …<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-is-the-fizzy-drink-in-bfg></span>What is the fizzy drink in BFG?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Frobscottle Make the BFG’s favourite drink at home with this recipe for fizzing, whizzing, fantastic Frobscottle.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-is-a-whizzpopper></span>What is a Whizzpopper?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>The magical drink, with bubbles that float downwards, causes the giant to do a “whizzpopper” – <b>an explosive form of flatulence</b> – that he describes as “a sign of true happiness”, although Sophie doesn’t seem convinced at first.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-did-bfg-drink></span>What did BFG drink?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Frobscottle <b>Frobscottle</b> is a drink found in Giant Country, in “The BFG.” It is the only known drink to be consumed there.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-vegi-terribles-to-make-frobscottle></span>What Vegi Terribles to make Frobscottle?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Firmly insisting that he eats only “beans” and hates “vegi-terribles”, <b>the Fleshlumpeater leaves</b>, stealing the BFG’s bottle of frobscottle.
