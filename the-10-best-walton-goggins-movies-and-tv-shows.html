He’s been involved in laugh-out-loud comedies, heartbreaking dramas, and big-budget action films, which just goes to show his vast range and ability as an actor. Whether he’s riffing humorously as he does in The Righteous Gemstones, or giving a nuanced, deeply emotional performance as he does in That Evening Sun, the actor is always an engaging presence that gives it his all. Whether you’re a fan of his, or just saw him in something and can’t get his performance out of your head, check out our list of the best Walton Goggins movies and TV shows!</p>Recommended Videos<h2 class="wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=h-10-ant-man-and-the-wasp data-injectable=false>10. Ant-Man and the Wasp</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-embed-handler wp-block-embed-embed-handler wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p class="wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-characters=706 data-current-count=1006 data-injectable=true>Goggins plays a villain in this Paul Rudd action sequel, which ended up being both a commercial and critical hit for the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">MCU</a> when it was released back in 2018. The movie chronicles the adventures of Scott Lang/Ant-Man (Rudd) and Hope Pym/the Wasp (Evangeline Lilly) as they join up with Pym’s father to try and rescue her mother from the Quantum Realm. However, they realize they need a part from a dodgy dealer named Sonny Burch (Goggins), who ends up double-crossing them in the hope of profiting off of the research being done by the Pym clan. Goggins brings the perfect blend of humor and seriousness as the bad guy and is a big part of the reason why this film is so beloved by many Marvel fans.</p><h2 class="wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-injectable=false>9. Sons of Anarchy</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p class="wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-characters=708 data-current-count=1008 data-injectable=true>Although Goggins only appeared in six episodes across three of seven seasons in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Sons of Anarchy</a>, he was nominated for a Critics Choice Award for Best Guest Performance for his role as Venus Van Damme, a trans sex worker who eventually became an ally of the gang and enters into a romantic relationship with Tig. Although the role would probably be taken by a trans actor today, there’s no doubt Goggins made sure his character was portrayed with nuance, something a lot of trans characters don’t get the courtesy of, as they often end up being the butt of jokes thanks to lazy writing. Plus, he gets to deliver some of the funniest lines in the series, usually at the expense of the tough bikers.</p><h2 class="wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-injectable=false>8. That Evening Sun</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p class="wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-characters=742 data-current-count=1042 data-injectable=true>Goggins again only has a small part in this tightly plotted, emotional film, but he’s excellent as the son of the protagonist (in the loosest sense of the word). The film follows Abner (<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Hal Holbrook</a>), a grouchy former farmer who escapes from the nursing home he’s been left in by his son Paul (Goggins), only to find that Paul has leased the farm to a family, headed by a man that Abner hates. What follows is a tale of revenge and redemption, ending in a painful climax in which Abner is almost killed, only to wake up in the hospital with Paul at his side. Brilliantly paced and with a cast all at the top of their game, That Evening Sun might not be Goggins’ longest performance, but it’s certainly a memorable one.</p><h2 class="wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-injectable=false>7. Tomb Raider</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p class="wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-characters=674 data-current-count=974 data-injectable=true>Replacing Angelina Jolie as the eponymous character in this film based on the famous game series was no easy task, but Alicia Vikander did an admirable job as <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Lara Croft</a>, aided by a supporting cast that included Goggins. The movie takes us on a journey alongside Croft as she travels to East Asia in an attempt to find her missing father, who is presumed dead, although she thinks he’s still around. Goggins is once again great as the villain, this time playing the part of Mathias Vogel, a long-term rival of the Croft family and a member of Trinity, a shady organization that has funded an exhibition to discover an ancient queen’s tomb and harness her power.</p><h2 class="wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-injectable=false>6. The Shield</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p class="wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-characters=702 data-current-count=1002 data-injectable=true>While most cop shows attempt to paint the police in an unfailingly positive light, FX show <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Shield</a> took a similar route to its contemporary The Wire, and instead focused on corruption in the force, and how officers often utilize illegal means to make sure their arrest numbers stay up, all while committing crimes themselves. Throughout the series, a number of incredible actors had guest appearances and longer arcs, including the legendary Glenn Close, and Chicano superstar Michael Peña. Goggins was a series regular and played the role of Shane Vendrell, a racist, reckless womanizer who doesn’t just bend the rules but snaps them. A great show that will have you hooked from episode one.</p><h2 class="wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-injectable=false>5. Justified</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p class="wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-characters=711 data-current-count=1011 data-injectable=true>This Kentucky-based neo-Western was critically acclaimed throughout its run, and holds up incredibly well to this day. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Justified</a> follows Appalachian locals in the eastern part of the state as they go about their daily lives, with the series delving into the local police force, Kentuckian crime families, and the personal issues that arise from working in such a small, tight-knit community. Goggins appears in season two but has a recurring role right until the series ends. He plays Boyd Crowder, the son of a famous criminal who is getting into the family business himself, and eventually becomes a born-again Christian to try and hide his tracks. A compelling character brought to life by some great acting.</p><h2 class="wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-injectable=false>4. Vice Principals</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p class="wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-characters=675 data-current-count=975 data-injectable=true>A brilliant albeit short-lived <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">HBO </a>black comedy, Vice Principals follows Neal Gamby (Danny McBride) and Lee Russell (Goggins) as two unlikable, petty, and veering on sociopathic co-vice principals who are determined to ruin the reputation of their new boss so she leaves the school and Gamby can replace her as principal. However, the more they scheme, the more their incompetence gets in the way, alienating them from other members of staff and pushing Gamby further away from his dream. Goggins is absolutely hilarious throughout the two-season run, as evidenced by the fact he won the Critics Choice Award for Best Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series for the role of Lee.</p><h2 class="wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-injectable=false>3. Django Unchained</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p class="wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-characters=617 data-current-count=917 data-injectable=true>Goggins shows off his nasty side once more as the brutal plantation overseer Billy Crash in this <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Tarantino </a>alternative history Western. The movie follows Django (Jamie Foxx), an escaped enslaved man who is attempting to find his wife and gain freedom for them both. Goggins appears toward the climax of the film, and his presence is as unnerving and tense as you’d expect, given that his character is tasked with castrating the titular character. The menace shines through, and it’s a testament to his acting that viewers are pretty happy to see him brutally murdered in the film’s explosive ending.</p><h2 class="wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-injectable=false>2. The Righteous Gemstones</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=602 data-current-count=902 data-injectable=true>Danny McBride and Goggins team up once more in a brilliant dark comedy, although this time he’s a little less sociopathic and a lot more pathetic (in all the right ways). <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Righteous Gemstones</a> follows the Gemstone clan, a group of thieving megachurch owners and Christian grifters (which, in reality, is the vast majority of Christian pastors who adhere to the Prosperity Gospel). Goggins plays Baby Billy Freeman, the brother-in-law of the Gemstone patriarch and a child star turned pathological liar who is doing God’s work by scamming the rest of the family of their ill-gotten gains.</p><h2 class="wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-injectable=false>1. The Accountant</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=647 data-current-count=947 data-injectable=false>Goggins both produced and acted in this Oscar-winning short film that explores the plight of farmers in the U.S. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Ray McKinnon</a> directs and stars in the short, playing the titular role of the accountant, whose mathematical abilities might help save the O’Dell family from losing their beloved farm. Goggins plays Tommy O’Dell, a member of the family and one of the characters who the accountant tries to inspire and help throughout the course of the film. Full of whimsy but with a very important message about how those who grow our crops are being crushed, this is an excellent movie that’s well worth the accolades it picked up.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2TBqbGMamdmmpWowW7DwKWrqKZdnLyos8inqmaln6u2pr%2BMmqWdZaSrerS0zrCqaA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fthe-10-best-walton-goggins-movies-and-tv-shows.html&text=The%2010%20best%20Walton%20Goggins%20movies%20and%20TV%20shows&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fthe-10-best-walton-goggins-movies-and-tv-shows.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fthe-10-best-walton-goggins-movies-and-tv-shows.html&title=The%2010%20best%20Walton%20Goggins%20movies%20and%20TV%20shows" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fthe-10-best-walton-goggins-movies-and-tv-shows.html&title=The%2010%20best%20Walton%20Goggins%20movies%20and%20TV%20shows" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fthe-10-best-walton-goggins-movies-and-tv-shows.html&title=The%2010%20best%20Walton%20Goggins%20movies%20and%20TV%20shows" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fthe-10-best-walton-goggins-movies-and-tv-shows.html&description=The%2010%20best%20Walton%20Goggins%20movies%20and%20TV%20shows" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./the-middle-cast-net-worth-salary.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The Middle Cast Net Worth  Actor Salary and Earnings">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./suelyn-medeiros-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography-how-much-money-make-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Suelyn Medeiros Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
