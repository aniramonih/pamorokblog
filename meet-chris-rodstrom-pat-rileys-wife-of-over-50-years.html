Rodstrom in 1951 in San Diego, California. Her nationality is American while her ethnicity is Caucasian and she hails from a family of seven. Her father is the late Frank Rodstrom, a Navy submariner, while her mother is the late Dorothy Rodstrom, a nurse who also devoted her time to helping alcoholics.</p><p>Chris Rodstrom has four brothers namely; Tom, Bill, John, and Richard Rodstrom. Chris Rodstrom grew up in San Diego and completed her high school diploma sometime in the 60s. She later pursued a college degree as the years passed by. She also went on to complete a <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">master’s degree</a> in educational psychology sometime in the 70s.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzzsouthafrica.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2022/10/Chris-Rodstrom.jpg><h2><strong>She is a Former Licensed Therapist and Marriage Counsellor</strong></h2><p>While it is hard to decipher her present career pursuits, Chris Rodstrom previously made her living as a licensed therapist and marriage counselor in Los Angeles. It is difficult to tell the exact places where she worked or whether she set up her own private practice, but one can tell what her work would have entailed.</p><p>Marriage counselors are licensed therapists who help couples or married individuals work through the problems in their relationships and resolve their conflicts. They provide mental health services that are specifically focused on relationships and marriages. There is no doubt that Chris Rodstrom would have used her expertise to offer help to many clients.</p><h2><strong>Chris Rodstrom and Pat Riley Began Dating in 1967 and Wed in 1970</strong></h2><p>Chris Rodstrom first met her future husband, Pat Riley, in San Diego in 1967. At that time, he was playing for the professional basketball team in the city while she was still studying. They fell in love with each other and started dating, and their relationship blossomed from the get-go.</p><p>Rodstrom introduced her boyfriend to her family members and they accepted him. They also became passionate basketball fans and joined her in supporting him. Rodstrom and Riley dated for a few years before getting engaged and tying the knot.</p><p>They got married on the 26th of June 1970 in San Diego. The ceremony was witnessed by their loved ones, including family and close friends.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzzsouthafrica.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2022/10/Chris-Rodstrom-4.jpg><h2><strong>The Couple’s Marriage Has Spanned Five Decades With No Scandals and Unpleasant Rumors</strong></h2><p>Chris Rodstrom and Pat Riley have been married for more than five decades now. Within this period, they have avoided unsavory scandals and infidelity rumors. They have rather remained committed to each other and have helped each other to get over several issues.</p><p>For instance, when Pat Riley’s playing career abruptly came to an end in 1976, he was at a loss as to what to do with his life. He was, therefore, sad and angry and went through a mourning period.</p><p>Rodstrom encouraged him to <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">mourn</a> but reminded him that it wasn’t okay to mourn forever. This way, he dealt with his issues and was able to begin the second stage of his career as a wildly successful coach.</p><p>His coaching career also came with its highs and lows but Chris Rodstrom has remained supportive of her husband through it all. He deeply appreciates her as a result, and considers her in any decision that touches his career as he recognizes that she will be affected as well.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzzsouthafrica.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2022/10/Chris-Rodstrom-1.jpg><h2><strong>Chris Rodstrom and Pat Riley Have Two Children&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Chris Rodstrom has <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">two children</a> with her husband, Pat Riley. They include a son named Patrick, who was born in 1985, and a daughter named Elisabeth Marie, who was born in 1989. The couple adopted both kids after they found it hard to conceive.</p><p>The children brought a lot of joy into the Chris and Pat’s lives and they made sure to lavish a lot of love on them. They gave them access to all material things that they could ask for. They also cared for them and did normal parents’ stuff such as helping them set up their first apartment or move into their college dorm room for the first time.</p><p>Patrick and Elisabeth are all grown up now and live their life out of the spotlight. They do not have much social media presence, making it difficult to know what they are up to. There is, however, no doubt that they would have built thriving careers as they are college-educated folks.</p><p>Additionally, Elisabeth Marie is married. Riley has previously spoken of her wedding day in during an interview.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzzsouthafrica.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2022/10/Chris-Rodstrom-3.jpg><h2><strong>Rodstrom Has Joined Her Husband in Supporting Charitable Endeavors Over the Years</strong></h2><p>Despite being the wife of one of the most iconic figures in the NBA, Chris Rodstrom prefers living her life out of the spotlight and as such, she rarely grants interviews. She also avoids other types of media appearances. The only time that she is seen out and about is when she joins her husband for various award ceremonies. She has also joined him courtside to watch some NBA games.</p><p>In addition to supporting her husband’s career, Chris Rodstrom has also supported his charitable endeavors. They regularly attend charity benefits and galas together and donate money. They have also founded charity organizations such as the Miami Heat Family Outreach and the Pediatric AIDS Foundation’s Kids for Kids organization. In 2017, the couple <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">donated</a> more than a million dollars to help people affected by Hurricane Irma.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapa%2FHtLvUrZ%2BanqKesKJ6wqikaK2jZLqmsdNmmqGqmah6s7vDrKurp51ivaLAjKugpZ2pqHq4tcWeZKieXaTDpr6MbmdmsZWWv7R7</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fmeet-chris-rodstrom-pat-rileys-wife-of-over-50-years.html&text=Meet%20Chris%20Rodstrom%2c%20Pat%20Riley%27s%20Wife%20of%20Over%2050%20Years&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmeet-chris-rodstrom-pat-rileys-wife-of-over-50-years.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmeet-chris-rodstrom-pat-rileys-wife-of-over-50-years.html&title=Meet%20Chris%20Rodstrom%2c%20Pat%20Riley%27s%20Wife%20of%20Over%2050%20Years" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fmeet-chris-rodstrom-pat-rileys-wife-of-over-50-years.html&title=Meet%20Chris%20Rodstrom%2c%20Pat%20Riley%27s%20Wife%20of%20Over%2050%20Years" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fmeet-chris-rodstrom-pat-rileys-wife-of-over-50-years.html&title=Meet%20Chris%20Rodstrom%2c%20Pat%20Riley%27s%20Wife%20of%20Over%2050%20Years" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmeet-chris-rodstrom-pat-rileys-wife-of-over-50-years.html&description=Meet%20Chris%20Rodstrom%2c%20Pat%20Riley%27s%20Wife%20of%20Over%2050%20Years" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./millie-bobby-brown-knee-high-boots-knitted-dress.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Millie Bobby Brown looks unreal in ribbed mini dress and killer boots">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./matthew-nilo-rape-and-sexual-assault-case-arrest-news-and-wiki.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Matthew Nilo Rape And Sexual Assault Case, Arrest News And Wiki">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
