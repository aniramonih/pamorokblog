Jordan reportedly walked into a convenience store around midnight. “She looked nervous, very tired, and like someone [fought] with her,” the store clerk told 19 News. “She says someone tried to kill her.”Jordan then asked the store clerk for his phone via which she dialled 911 for help.&nbsp;</p><p>The clerk who came to Jordan’s aid said the EMT's shirt was ripped and looked as though it had been burned. Dispatch audio revealed Jordan told first responders that she ran away from her kidnappers, who tried to burn her alive. Authorities told a dispatcher “You’re never going to believe this, we just got a call from Lachelle Jordan... She said that she ran away from the people that kidnapped her and they tried to burn her alive.”</p><p>Cleveland EMS Union President Mark Barrett sent the following statement to 19 News: “We are happy she’s been found alive and safe. We ask that she be given time to heal. We remain ready to support her and her family any way we can.” Jordan, a mother of two, had been missing for five-and-a-half days. Jordan was last seen the night of May 6 in Cleveland’s Glenville neighborhood.</p><p>-----------------------</p><p>FAIRPORT AVENUE, CLEVELAND: In a series of distressing events in Cleveland, Lachelle Jordan, a 30-year-old emergency medical technician (EMT), has gone missing just days before she was scheduled to testify in a rape trial. The victim, who recently told police she had “fears for her safety,” mysteriously vanished after stepping outside her home to retrieve something from her car on Fairport Avenue in Cleveland Saturday night, May 6.&nbsp;</p><p>Jordan's family reported her missing the next day. It has now come to light that Jordan had filed three complaints about being stalked on multiple occasions prior to her disappearance.</p><p><strong>READ MORE</strong></p><p><a href=# rel>THE MISSING FILES: Man who lives near spot where Summer Wells disappeared claims family is hiding truth</a></p><p><a href=# rel>Beau Mann's heartbreaking chat about adopting children with his fiance before fatal trip revealed</a></p><p dir=ltr lang=en>MISSING FEMALE ENDANGERED: Lachelle Jordan, age 30, missing from 11608 Fairpoint Avenue.

Anonymous information can be provided by calling Crimestoppers at 216-25-CRIME. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/KrWqf5ESb6</a></p>— Cleveland Police (@CLEpolice) <a href=#>May 8, 2023</a><p class=end-of-block-quote>&nbsp;</p><h2 class=split>Who is Lachelle Jordan?</h2><p>Lachelle Jordan, a mother of two, is an Ohio-based emergency medical technician. Prior to her disappearance, she reported being stalked on multiple occasions. The 30-year-old was supposed to attend a pretrial hearing on Monday in a rape case involving Michael Stennett, 65, a longtime youth baseball coach charged with two counts of rape and one count of abduction in May 2022. Just two days prior to her disappearance, Jordan told police that Stennett “was watching her from his vehicle” as she left the same Fairport Avenue home that morning.</p><h2 class=split>'I want my daughter back'</h2><p>Jordan also claimed that a female friend of Stennett's had followed her on the freeway, attempting to force her off the road, raising concerns that these individuals were trying to prevent Jordan from testifying in Stennett's rape trial. With the alarming circumstances surrounding her disappearance, the community, including her family, friends, and members of the women's empowerment group BrickHouse Wellness, have rallied together to search for Lachelle Jordan. Her family, particularly her father Joseph Jordan, made an emotional plea for her safe return, expressing the deep anguish caused by her absence.</p><p>“I want my daughter back, I want her well. If you can do that, then that’s what works for me,” he said. “That would take away the hurt, that would take away the pain, that would take away the sorrow,” as per <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">New York Post</a>. Jordan’s twin sister, Rachelle, who has been staying with her, claimed she went to put her sister's children, ages 8 and 4, to bed when she realized Jordan was not home. She also added that a window in the home was shot through at about 6 am on the day of her missing.</p><p>Cleveland police are actively investigating Lachelle Jordan's disappearance and urged anyone with information to come forward. “We couldn’t protect her when our job is taking care and protecting the public,” said Mark Barrett, the president of Cleveland’s EMS union. “I think it just got to the point where the city knew they needed to get her out of the field.” Barrett added, “This certainly wasn’t planned. Something happened. She’s missing,” Barrett said. Jordan is identified as 5 feet 2 inches tall and weighs 150 pounds. She has black hair and brown eyes. To aid in locating her, CrimeStoppers has offered a $5,000 reward for information leading to her whereabouts.</p><h2 class=split>'Why wouldn’t they put her in protection?'</h2><p>Internet users expressed their concern for Jordan's well-being and demanded that justice be served if foul play was involved. One user wrote, "This poor lady." Another added, "Why wouldn’t they put her in protection knowing this could d*mn we’ll be because if her testimony?" A third said, "I hope she’s somewhere safe." A fourth tweeted, "WOW! She was main witness!" "Hope she is found. Her poor family," another tweet read.&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>This poor lady.</p>— Kristi Bykowski (@AGypsyGirlLife) <a href=#>May 12, 2023</a><p class=end-of-block-quote>&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Why wouldn’t they put her in protection knowing this could d*mn we’ll be because if her testimony?</p>— ʙᴇʟʟᴇ (@NorthernBelll) <a href=#>May 12, 2023</a><p class=end-of-block-quote>&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>I hope she’s somewhere safe 🙏🏽</p>— Tra (@Tra31484005) <a href=#>May 11, 2023</a><p class=end-of-block-quote>&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Hope she is found.
