There is 100% a way to save karlach. There might not be a way to repair her heart entirely but it is possible for her to live past end credits at least.</p><h2>Can I revive Karlach after killing her?</h2><p>After speaking with Wyll, his dialogue about Karlach being killed should trigger. After talking with him, double-check to make sure the journal entry has updated to reflect that Karlach has been killed. Then, adventurers can head straight back to Karlach and resurrect her.</p><h2>Can I save Karlach and Wyll?</h2><p>In normal circumstances, players lose both companions when they attack the tieflings. However, it’s possible to save the party by recruiting Karlach and Wyll, killing both characters in camp, and reviving them after raiding the Emerald Grove.</p><h2>Is there a way to save Karlach reddit?</h2><p>At a certain point in Wyll’s Act 1 storyline you must choose to either help him kill Karlach, or talk him into saving Karlach. If you are playing as Wyll this choice is yours entirely. If you save Karlach you defy Wyll’s pact patron and he is punished— he is transformed into a devil!</p><h2>Keep Karlach Alive and Complete Mizora’s Quest in Baldur’s Gate 3</h2><h2>Can I save Karlach without dammon?</h2><p>It’s imperative you don’t kill Dammon during this Act as well, whether it be from slaughtering the Emerald Grove or accidentally starting a war where the druids and Tieflings kill each other, otherwise you’ll be locked out of this quest, as he’s the only person who can stabilize Karlach’s Infernal Engine.</p><h2>Can you fix Karlach’s heart?</h2><p>Go to your camp to trigger the Wyll and Mizora scene, then talk to Karlach about this event. Speak with Dammon and give him the second Infernal Iron for Karlach’s heart. This will let you kiss her without any issues. Go back to your camp and talk to Karlach.</p><h2>Will Karlach leave if you raid the Grove?</h2><p>Karlach is very passionate about the lives of her fellow people. If you decide to raid the grove, Karlach will leave your party immediately. She will also not join your party if you’ve done this before recruiting her.</p><h2>Does Karlach have a happy ending?</h2><p>The player is able to turn her away from Shar and rescue her parents, resulting in a very happy ending. Even if she still has a twinge of pain from time-to-time, she has her family back and has a new lease on life. She’s happy and feels like the future is hers to mold.</p><h2>What happens if Wyll kills Karlach?</h2><p>If you spare her, Wyll is transformed into a Devil, and if you kill her, You get a really cool armour piece.</p><h2>Can you recruit Karlach?</h2><p>Note that you must have an available slot in your party so Karlach can join up. If you don’t, she’ll run to the location of a battle, and she’ll be an AI-controlled NPC for the fight. Karlach is waiting for you next to a river.</p><h2>Can I recruit Karlach and Wyll?</h2><p>Once you’ve calmed Wyll down, you can carry on the conversation with Karlach as normal and recruit her if you wish. If you haven’t recruited Wyll at all and you recruit Karlach, a scene will play out when you next go camping in which Wyll arrives at your camp to kill Karlach.</p><h2>Who does Karlach loathe?</h2><p>Karlach despises Zariel because of what she took from her, not due to her treatment over the 10 years of her servitude.</p><h2>What is Karlach’s new ending?</h2><p>Depending on your choices and whether or not you’ve completed certain questlines, Karlach can either turn into a Mind Flayer and shed the engine entirely, return to Avernus (one of Dungeons & Dragons’ layers of Hell), or accept her fate and die after the final battle.</p><h2>Should I send Karlach to Avernus?</h2><p>She can either return to Avernus with Wyll or return to Avernus with the player by her side, but as stated before, returning to Avernus is definitely something players who care about Karlach don’t want to do, and there’s no way of knowing what will happen to the player in Avernus if they choose to journey with Karlach.</p><h2>How do you get Karlach to become Mind Flayer?</h2><p>Make sure Karlach is in your active party when you go to the Morphic Pool. Later, once you talk to the Emperor, select: “Would I be able to wield…” or “I don’t care about Orpheus…” Karlach will suggest that she could become a Mind Flayer instead.</p><h2>Can you get Karlach as a companion?</h2><p>Karlach is an Origin character in Baldur’s Gate 3. Origin characters are playable heroes who have their own stories, desires, and attitudes toward the world. You can play as Karlach to live out her story, or you can choose to create a custom character and recruit her as a companion instead.</p><h2>Can I go to Avernus with Karlach?</h2><p>You can choose to go to Avernus with Karlach even if you romanced someone else, but you won’t get the ‘cool’ cinematic, it simply jump cuts to credits.</p><h2>Can you miss Karlach?</h2><p>If you progressed into Act two, then you missed her. Be wary of any zone-transition that the game throws a warning to you about progressing through, those are typically points of no return. I killed her and regret it. I’ll make sure to pick her up in my 2nd playthrough.</p><h2>Is Karlach evil in BG3?</h2><p>No alignment, so you have to guess or make it up yourself, as it should be. She seems like a sweet girl on her date though. While there’s no alignment technically in BG3, Karlach is very obviously a good-aligned character.</p><h2>Can you have Karlach and Minthara at the same time?</h2><p>With no mods and I have Karlach, Minthara and Wyll. Both K and W will leave you turn on you if you attack the grove. But Minthara can be asked opinions about both Wyll and Karlach in your camp.</p><h2>Can you get Minthara without being evil?</h2><p>A Baldur’s Gate 3 player manages to find a creative loophole that allows them to recruit Minthara to their party without having to first commit to an evil playthrough.</p><h2>Can you romance Astarion and Karlach?</h2><p>While Karlach is incapable of being in a physically intimate relationship with players, she is open to players having intimate relationships with others. This is most likely to be Astarion, as the other polyamorous romance option, Halsin, is not available until later.</p><h2>Is it too late to romance Karlach BG3?</h2><p>There’s no time limit on this, however, so feel free to continue adventuring until you fancy a romantic interlude. Back at camp, chat to Karlach and respond positively to her desire for intimacy. You can lean in for a kiss at this point, and then agree to meet up once everyone is asleep.</p><h2>Can you still romance Karlach in Act 3?</h2><p>How to Romance Karlach in Act 3. Once you get to the Lower City in Baldur’s Gate, if your approval is high enough with Karlach, you’ll get the option to speak to her in camp, like normal. She’ll invite you out to a date in the city. Choose to accept and head to your date spot.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r6%2FErJpnm5%2BifKitzKKloGWWlr5wtM6wZJ2nXa68tnnKnpypZZuWv62twqFkmqSZq7Jw</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fhow-do-you-keep-karlach-alive.html&text=How%20do%20you%20keep%20Karlach%20alive%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fhow-do-you-keep-karlach-alive.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fhow-do-you-keep-karlach-alive.html&title=How%20do%20you%20keep%20Karlach%20alive%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fhow-do-you-keep-karlach-alive.html&title=How%20do%20you%20keep%20Karlach%20alive%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fhow-do-you-keep-karlach-alive.html&title=How%20do%20you%20keep%20Karlach%20alive%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fhow-do-you-keep-karlach-alive.html&description=How%20do%20you%20keep%20Karlach%20alive%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./how-much-are-the-brothers-from-oak-island-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="How much are the brothers from Oak Island worth?">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./haylie-duff-net-worth-2020-2021.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Haylie Duff Net Worth 2024: Age, Height, Weight, Boyfriend, Dating, Bio-Wiki">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
