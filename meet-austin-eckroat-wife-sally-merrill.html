Eckroat has demonstrated his abilities and passion for the sport since childhood.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Eckroat is carving out a promising future in golf with an exceptional track record in amateur golf and a seamless transition into the professional ranks.</span></p><p>Also Read: <a href=# rel=bookmark>Ava Costa Gymnastics Accident: Injury And Health Update</a></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Eckroat’s PGA Tour statistics reflect his ability on the course. With an average of 3.69 birdies per round, he continually demonstrates his ability to score well. In addition, his performance includes many eagles, demonstrating his ability to capitalize on scoring opportunities.</span></p><h2><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Who Is Austin Eckroat Wife Sally Merrill? Relationship Timeline</span></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Eckroat, 22, proposed to girlfriend Sally Merrill last week at Oklahoma State’s home club, Karsten Creek. Since they were 18 months old, Eckroat and Merrill have known each other.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>They shared babysitters and remained friends even when Merrill’s family relocated from Edmond to Oklahoma City. Merrill, an Oklahoma student and the Cowboys star, began dating approximately two years ago.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/tvshowstars.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/chrome-capture-2023-4-11-1.png><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>“Fortunately, we found our way back to each other, and we’re now engaged,” Eckroat added. “Isn’t it strange how that happens?”</span></p><p>Also Read: <a href=# rel=bookmark>Meet Jareth Loveberry Wife Stacie Loveberry – Kids And Family</a></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Merrill and her family are part of a big contingent in the Arizona desert supporting Eckroat, including Eckroat’s parents, Steve and Natalie, his sister, Taylor, and about a half-dozen aunts and uncles. They were all eager to be present for Eckroat’s final college tournament.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Eckroat stated earlier this month that he would be turning pro after nationals, concluding a remarkable Stillwater career featuring two triumphs, 15 top-10 finishes, and four All-America honors. He was also a member of the Cowboys’ NCAA championship team in 2018.</span></p><h2><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Who Are Austin Eckroat Parents? Family Explored</span></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Austin, who grew up wearing Swinging Pete logos to every tournament, won a high school state championship as a freshman at Karsten Creek and committed to the Cowboys shortly after.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Steve and Natalie Eckroat’s son. He was born on January 12, 1999, in Edmond. Taylor, one of her sisters, attended OSU. Oklahoma, Texas A&M, and SMU were also interested in him.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/tvshowstars.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/DSC00074.jpg><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Not surprisingly, the youngster with Oklahoma State football jerseys and posters on his bedroom walls had no intention of considering any other programs.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Austin’s love for the school was a significant reason he didn’t go pro last summer.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Another reason to stay in school was PGA Tour University, which launched this season and gave the top seniors at the end of the NCAA Championship status on the Korn Ferry Tour and the Tour’s other developmental tours.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Eckroat began the season ranked third on the PGA Tour U and never slipped out of the top five.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>He joins Florida State’s John Pak, Georgia’s Davis Thompson, Arizona State’s Kevin Yu, and Oklahoma’s Garett Reband as the top five players who will be exempt from at least eight Korn Ferry Tour events this summer and get a trip to the final stage of KFT Q-School later this year.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Eckroat will make his pro debut in the BMW Charity Pro-Am in Greer, South Carolina, next week. Apart from Pak, three other top-five members will join Eckroat there. Pak is currently competing in the PGA Tour’s Palmetto Tournament at Congaree.</span></p><h2><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Austin Eckroat Career Explored</span></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The golfer competed at the 2020 U.S. Amateur for the fourth time at the 2020 Southern Amateur Championship, placing sixth. Participated in the Pebble Beach 2019 U.S. Open Championship.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The pro golfer missed the cut following 72 and 75 carding rounds. He was a participant in the 2019 U.S. Palmer Cup team. He finished in a tie for tenth place in the Trans-Mississippi Amateur Championship in 2019.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Earned second place at the Oklahoma Golf Association State Amateur Championship in 2019 for the second straight year… at the 2019 U.S. Amateur Championship, recorded a pair of 72s to move on to match play.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>He ran a close second at the 2018 Pacific Coast Amateur. Scored 65, 67, 71, and 70 for an 11-under total of 273. Comrade Hayden beat him out.</span></p><h2>Adding Milestones To His Journey: <span data-preserver-spaces=true>Austin Eckroat Finished Second At AT&T Byron Nelson</span></h2><p>Golf has long since moved from being a simple American favorite pastime. Now, it is one of the most-played and most-watched sports worldwide. In addition, golf tournaments offer considerable prize money, attracting players from all levels to participate.</p><p>Likewise, the 2023 AT&T Byron Nelson tournament invited players from different nations. The event held between May 11 and May 14 offered prize money of $9.5 million. Furthermore, while former world number 1 Jason Day took home <span style=font-family:var(--global-body-font-family)>$1,710,000, it was Austin who emerged as a dark horse.</span></p><p>The emerging golf star took home $845,500 and earned massive respect from the golf community. Only in his early twenties, Austin’s performance was nothing short of praiseworthy. He tied with Si Woo Kim for second place and was only a stroke behind the 2023 AT&T Byron Nelson champion.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/tvshowstars.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Austin.jpg><p>Moreover, Austin’s best round of the weekend happened on Saturday when he carded an 8-under 63. It was also the lowest round of his career. Although he couldn’t win the trophy, his second ranking speaks volumes about his playing prowess.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter">The victory was the golf player’s second top-five finish of the 2023 season. He previously finished fifth at the Corales Puntacana Championship in March. In addition, he was tied for 12th position at the Sony Open in January in Hawaii. He has several more victories under his belt.</figure>&nbsp; Hence, the sky is but the limit for the emerging sportsman. As we are just entering the 2023 season, it will be fascinating to see how he will progress further in the upcoming months. Austin’s partner, <span data-preserver-spaces=true>Sally Merrill, must be over the moon following his victory.</span> &nbsp; To conclude, we wish Austin <span data-preserver-spaces=true>Eckroat more success and prosperity in the future. Hopefully, he will keep winning and adding new milestones to his golf journey.</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmispqi1sMPSrZirq16YvK57zJ6crWWRqsC1tc1mnJyjoqSutXnWop2eZaOWua3FjKacq6qZoblw</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fmeet-austin-eckroat-wife-sally-merrill.html&text=Meet%20Austin%20Eckroat%20Wife%20Sally%20Merrill&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmeet-austin-eckroat-wife-sally-merrill.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmeet-austin-eckroat-wife-sally-merrill.html&title=Meet%20Austin%20Eckroat%20Wife%20Sally%20Merrill" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fmeet-austin-eckroat-wife-sally-merrill.html&title=Meet%20Austin%20Eckroat%20Wife%20Sally%20Merrill" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fmeet-austin-eckroat-wife-sally-merrill.html&title=Meet%20Austin%20Eckroat%20Wife%20Sally%20Merrill" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmeet-austin-eckroat-wife-sally-merrill.html&description=Meet%20Austin%20Eckroat%20Wife%20Sally%20Merrill" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./meghan-markle-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Meghan Markle Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./media-artist-kit-porter-passes-away-at-40.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Media Artist Kit Porter Passes Away at 40">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
