His parents divorced when he was 4 years old and then split his time between Idaho Falls and Twin Falls. He was always an avid outdoor kid with a keen interest in farming.</p><p>In 2019, Dylan's grandfather had purchased land in Lucin. Dylan took care of the land, cultivated the crop and started living alone in a camper on the property. During the phone calls prior to May 28, Dylan has exclaimed his excitement about his first crop of the year. Dylan was running the farm mostly alone but had outside help from a few people. On the 30th of May, one of Dylan's friends got worried and called Dylan's mother. As per interviews with the mother, the family and several other people in town along with the friend went to Dylan's farm to look for him.</p><p>After their initial search, they were sure that Dylan's phone, wallet and a handgun he'd always carry on his person were also missing.</p><table class="info small"><tr><td class=by>by <span>Anonymous</span></td><td class=count>reply 2</td><td class=timestamp><span>July 5, 2022 7:20 PM</span></td></tr></table><p>Dylan's truck (a maroon Ford) was found on the property but it was locked, which is unusually because he never tends to lock it. The family proceeded to break the window in order to gain access to the truck.</p><p>The car seat was moved forward and the mother noticed that Dylan's seat is usually further back because he is quite tall. The truck had also been pressure washed on the outside and the truck bed. The wash also removed any marks on the ground,</p><p>The truck was also in 4 wheel drive, a setting that didn't work on Dylan's truck and he didn't use for this particular reason.</p><p>Officials then pinged his phone and subsequently found Dylan's only pair of boots, 100 yards south of where Dylan's grain truck was parked.</p><table class="info small"><tr><td class=by>by <span>Anonymous</span></td><td class=count>reply 3</td><td class=timestamp><span>July 5, 2022 7:23 PM</span></td></tr></table><p>Aidan Clune is a 19 year old who was last seen on the 27th of April around 50 miles South of Wells, Nevada.</p><p>his vehicle was found abandoned and his tracks were eventually lost.
