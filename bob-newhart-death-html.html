In 1960, he made it huge. The Button-Down Mind of Bob Newhart,&nbsp;his debut album, won three Grammys, including a surprise: Best Album.</p><p>In the 1970s, Newhart starred as Chicago psychologist Robert Hartley in The Bob Newhart Show&nbsp;and then as Vermont innkeeper Dick Loudon in the 1980s sitcom Newhart.</p><h2>Is Bob Newhart Still Alive?</h2><p>Newhart’s dad lived till the age of 85, and his mother till the age of 94. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Perhaps that gives away the answer to the question, "is Bob Newhart still alive?"</p><p>And, perhaps that is the reason Newhart is very alive and in good health.</p><p>The comedian only recently turned to a staggering age of 92, thanks to his genes, on September 5, 2021.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>"I have this theory that when it's all over, for death, and you go up I've been led to believe in&nbsp;heaven and that&nbsp;there's a God and he says, 'What did you do?' And I say, 'I made people laugh.' 'Yeah, get in that real short line over there.'" said Newhart in an interview with <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">CBS News</a>.</p><p>He has a thing or two to say about death. He said&nbsp;that he wasn't sure what was&nbsp;on the other side of life or if people came back to it after death.</p><p>However, the The Button-Down Mind Strikes Back artist is looking forward to waking up in heaven after he passes away.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-618 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><h2>Bob Newhart on Health and Relationship</h2><p>When asked about his marriage, which lasted for more than 58 years, Newhart credited laughter as&nbsp;the secret sauce for keeping his relationship in good health. “If you can laugh you can get through it,” he said to the <a href=# rel="follow noopener">New York Times</a> reporter. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>Newhart is a true family man. After all the accolades and honors he has received, Newhart still believes that it’s all about friends and family in the end.</p><p>In fact, <a href=# rel="follow noopener">according to him</a>, his only regret is that he didn’t get married to his wife, Ginny,&nbsp;earlier.</p><p>He wishes there was someone with him when his first record came out and hit number one. Newhart was short of money at the time and therefore couldn’t get married.</p><p>When he lost some of his close friends, Newhart realized that it was time he spent even more time with family.</p><p>One of his sisters, Mary Joan, passed away, due to health concerns, in 2018 just a couple of days short of making it to 90.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>Newhart has no thoughts on hanging his boots as a comic and plans to do it for the rest of his life, as long as he is in good health. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-175 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>He just rejoices in making people laugh and says that it is "in his blood."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaJqfl3qvsdahmKusXZmyosDHZ5%2BtpZw%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fbob-newhart-death-html.html&text=Is%20Bob%20Newhart%20Still%20Alive%3f%20His%20Thoughts%20on%20Death&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbob-newhart-death-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbob-newhart-death-html.html&title=Is%20Bob%20Newhart%20Still%20Alive%3f%20His%20Thoughts%20on%20Death" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fbob-newhart-death-html.html&title=Is%20Bob%20Newhart%20Still%20Alive%3f%20His%20Thoughts%20on%20Death" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fbob-newhart-death-html.html&title=Is%20Bob%20Newhart%20Still%20Alive%3f%20His%20Thoughts%20on%20Death" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbob-newhart-death-html.html&description=Is%20Bob%20Newhart%20Still%20Alive%3f%20His%20Thoughts%20on%20Death" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./is-it-safe-to-eat-fermented-pineapple-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Is it safe to eat fermented pineapple?">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./how-to-see-amazon-price-histories.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="How to See the Amazon Price History of a Product">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
