She says Maddie is up for a People’s Choice Award – the “seriously popular” award. She’s against Rubie Rose, Bella Thorne, Kylie Jenner and Cara Delevigne.</p><p>Abby is going along and has a plus one ticket. Jill says she wishes she was going and says they should all go to support Maddie. Abby says this week is busy busy since the minis are back. She says some cracked under pressure and another crazy mom with three daughters.</p><p>Abby gives them an audition. The dance moms introduce themselves to Jeannie and her kids Coco, Rihanna and Kaylee. The minis are short Mary and Lynn. Sari recognizes Jeannie from another studio and thinks she’s crazy. Melissa says Mackenzie is at home for a competition.</p><p>Ashlee asks if Mackenzie is back next season since Maddie is leaving the team. Melissa says she’s crazy and says she has no plans to leave. Holly says that’s the news and Melissa says it’s gossip and her daughter will never leave ALDC.</p><p>Abby says Jeannie’s three kids may be part of the mini team and the other moms may be screwed. Abby welcomes the minis and Holly says the best was when Abby and the minis are not around and says they produce chaos.</p><p>Abby congratulates the girls on the group win and starts pyramid. At the bottom is Mackenzie because she’s not here and next is Kalani. She says she rushed in the group. Next is Nia and says she’s moving Nia up a level because she served as a demonstrator in class for her.</p><p>JoJo is next and says she blended better in group. Kendall is next with Brynn and says Kendall was great in her solo. She says Brynn was transformed. At the top is Maddie for her overall high score and tonight she’s got Maddie at People’s Choice.</p><p>Jill says she knows Melissa gave Abby two tickets and wants to go so she can celebrity watch. They are traveling this week for Dream Dance Competition. The minis will perform a jazz routine called The Monsters. The junior team is doing The Vultures and the one solo goes to Maddie.</p><p>Maddie’s routine is called The People’s Choice or Not. They start rehearsal and Jeannie is surprised Kaylee is with the minis not the junior team even though her kid is 11. Abby wants her to be a leader for that team. Kaylee doesn’t like being with the younger ones.</p><p>Kerri laughs that Jeannie thought Kaylee would be with the juniors not the minis. Abby explains the group vulture routine. Abby is leaving early for the awards show and has to decide what to do with her extra ticket. Abby invites Brynn to go with her.</p><p>Brynn is floored and thrilled and wants to go. She says Brynn is always on the outs with the other kids because of her mom Ashlee. She wants to see how she behaves out in public. Jill was hoping Abby was calling to her but she was calling to Ashlee to tell her she’s taking Brynn.</p><p>Jill keeps ranting and Jessa says she should take Kendall since she’s her BFF. Jill asks if Melissa knows and Jessa says Melissa will die. Abby has to defend her choice and Jill says Melissa will be disappointed. Kendall tells her to have fun then Abby says she can’t take Brynn.</p><p>Abby says she’s tired of this fighting and asks if Kalani wants to go and she says she won’t take it away from Brynn. Kendall also refuses the invitation. Then she asks if Jill wants to go. OMG Jill reeks of desperation. At least the girls are acting like decent people – even if their moms aren’t.</p><p>Jill says she wants to go if Brynn is not. Ashlee asks what kind of person gets excited to take an opportunity away from a 12 year old girl and says Jill is a bitch. Ashlee says Brynn isn’t going because Jill acted out. Then Jill says she can’t go in that case.</p><p>Now Jill says she can’t go. Jessa says it’s a bad deal and no one wants to go. Ashlee says Brynn wanted to go until they ruined it for her daughter. Melissa says it was great and says Maddie won the award and was shocked and didn’t think she had a chance against the other celebs.</p><p>Jessa says she missed a lot of drama and Holly says it turned into world war three. Jill says Abby was going to take Brynn and Ashlee says it’s because she has never been to anything like that and Abby uninvited her because the moms acted out so horribly.</p><p>Abby comes out and says Maddie’s solo is now called People’s Choice and says she has to do an amazing job. She works on her solo. Abby says now that Maddie is a household name, critics will be looking to rip her apart and she won’t let that happen.</p><p>The minis show up and Melissa shows off the People’s Choice award to the mini moms. Melissa says Maddie had to turn down an amazing opportunity for the team. Jill says Melissa refuses to acknowledge that Maddie is leaving and says the team needs to plan for the future with or without her.</p><p>The minis rehearse with Gianna. Sari hopes they make the mini team an official thing. Kaylee gets criticism and rolls her eyes. The other moms tell Jeannie she’d better stop doing that or she’s going to get in trouble. Kaylee throws off her jacket and then stops dancing.</p><p>The other mini moms tell her mom that she needs to stop acting like that. Abby comes in to watch the routine and asks why Kaylee isn’t wearing her jacket and makes her put it back on. Abby watches and tells Gianna to let them take off their jackets.</p><p>Holly advises Jeannie to go check in with Kaylee. Jeannie says the other moms are saying Kaylee doesn’t care. Kaylee says what 11 year old wants to dance with six year olds and do a monster dance. The other mini moms think she has a bad attitude.</p><p>Jeannie encourages Kaylee to do this and work hard. Her kid is not happy. Abby talks to Maddie about her award and says she knows it’s more pressure and expectations. Abby says she has to get out on the stage and be everything they could imagine.</p><p>She asks Maddie about the rumors about her leaving ALDC. Abby says stopping her dancing would be detrimental. Abby says she can do it all and encourages her. Melissa says Jeannie’s daughter has an attitude and says JoJo always does goofy things and never rolls her eyes – she just does it.</p><p>Ashlee says she knows of Jeannie and heard she’s a trash talker. She reads them a social media post about ALDC and Abby and says there is bad behavior there and that she’s standing up for what’s right and that the other kids are not acting right.</p><p>Jeannie shows up with her kids and says they came by to tell Abby that her girls are leaving. Jill says she should hashtag finish what you start. Jeannie says she’s not Chloe and Jill tells the other minis to come in and they tell Jeannie they can’t believe she’s skipping out the day before competition.</p><p>The other moms lay into her and Abby comes out and says Jeannie is out of there and she’ll hear from her attorney for what she said about her business on social media. Abby says she feels bad for her daughters since they’re talented but their mother is the problem.</p><p>The mini moms talk about doing the group number as a trio. Abby says they could do it. She talks to the girls and says the other three are gone. They tell them they’re fine. Tiffanie hopes they don’t pull the number. Abby says they will make it a trio. They’re happy and go rehearse.</p><p>Ashlee says it’s more obvious if someone is off in a trio. Holly says that’s hard. Peyton is struggling. Abby doesn’t want to send the kids out on stage if it’s going to be a hot mess. Abby says two students are working on hip hop and is going to let them come in to scare the other kids.</p><p>It’s competition day and Jill says it’s been chaos all week. She says they need to show people the ALDC is strong. Jill asks Maddie if she’s staying at ALDC and Ashlee wants Melissa to make up her mind so they can make plans.</p><p>Abby shows up and calls Maddie up and says she wants kids in the audience to want to be like her. First up is solos. Maddie says Abby is putting a lot of pressure on her to win. Melissa cheers loudly when she’s done and says she was flawless like always.</p><p>The groups get ready and Abby says the minis look nervous. She worries they’re not stage ready. Abby calls in the hip hop duet and says Sammi and Jordan are going to do a duet against the trio. Abby says these two are dancing and they do their number.</p><p>Kerri wonders how long they’ve been practicing this. The mini moms are getting mad. Abby says the duet can still win if the trio bombed. Abby says the other three stabbed them in the back. Kerri freaks and Abby says let your kid rehearse.</p><p>Kerri screams at Abby to stop yelling in front of her daughter. Holly says it’s like back when another mom snapped. The mini moms walk out. Peyton is crying and Kerri is furious. The other kids encourage Peyton and tell her to show Abby what they can do.</p><p>They come back in and Kerri says they don’t deserve Abby messing with her kids’ ahead. The hip hop duet compete next. Sari says Abby made it clear she won’t settle for anything less than the best but there’s always an obstacle. She hopes the mini girls can do this.</p><p>The hip hop duet does well. The minis talk last minute before they take the stage. Now it’s their turn for The Monsters. Abby smiles as she watches. Abby says they did great. Abby says they were amazing and it’s the best she’s ever seen them dance and proved to her they want to dance.</p><p>Now it’s the junior elite group number. Holly says this whole week has been about mini drama and that left the elite team with scraps of Abby’s time. Now it’s awards time. First is solo awards. Melissa hopes Maddie takes first after she won the People’s Choice award.</p><p>Maddie wins first. Abby says she was exquisite and is a great ad for her studio. Now it’s mini awards. The minis take second place. The hip hop duo takes first place. Kerri is upset that the girls worked so hard only to lose. Now it’s the elite small group. They also take first place for The Vultures.</p><p>Jill says if Abby wants to build her business in LA she needs to pay more attention to the girls that built her business. Abby congratulates the minis and says they looked good on stage and gives them a few notes. Tiffanie hopes that Abby will commit to the minis since the older girls are moving on.</p><p>Kerri apologizes to Abby and Peyton says her mom is “disbehaving” and Abby says Peyton was reacting to Kerri and says she respects Abby and is sorry. Abby is still debating keeping the minis and says the moms need more class.</p><p>Tiffanie asks if Abby will have the minis back. Abby says her asking questions feels like an ultimatum and she doesn’t like it. Tiffanie pushes more and Abby says she doesn’t know.</p><p>THE END!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmdoaKpxq2t1Kebq7FemLyue5FpaG9nlJa7pLGMpqamq12nsqStz2Zqam1ha3q0scCspqdlZmKysbXSqJueZWFmerW0xGakmpyUnrJuvtSmpqtn</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fdance-moms-recap-31516-season-6-episode-11-the-maddie-rumor.html&text=Dance%20Moms%20Recap%203%2f15%2f16%3a%20Season%206%20Episode%2011%20The%20Maddie%20Rumor&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdance-moms-recap-31516-season-6-episode-11-the-maddie-rumor.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdance-moms-recap-31516-season-6-episode-11-the-maddie-rumor.html&title=Dance%20Moms%20Recap%203%2f15%2f16%3a%20Season%206%20Episode%2011%20The%20Maddie%20Rumor" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fdance-moms-recap-31516-season-6-episode-11-the-maddie-rumor.html&title=Dance%20Moms%20Recap%203%2f15%2f16%3a%20Season%206%20Episode%2011%20The%20Maddie%20Rumor" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fdance-moms-recap-31516-season-6-episode-11-the-maddie-rumor.html&title=Dance%20Moms%20Recap%203%2f15%2f16%3a%20Season%206%20Episode%2011%20The%20Maddie%20Rumor" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdance-moms-recap-31516-season-6-episode-11-the-maddie-rumor.html&description=Dance%20Moms%20Recap%203%2f15%2f16%3a%20Season%206%20Episode%2011%20The%20Maddie%20Rumor" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./desiree-wallace.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Desiree Wallace Wiki (Bubba Wallaces Mother) Age, Husband, Biography &amp;amp; More">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./cora-jade-sizzles-in-behind-the-scenes-video-drop-from-bikini-photo-shoot.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Cora Jade Sizzles In Behind-The-Scenes Video Drop From Bikini Photo Shoot">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
