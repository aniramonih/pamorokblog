While any tunic (or top) can be worn with leggings, there is one key feature that makes some better than others, especially if you're headed somewhere a bit more formal like the office. For those more dressed-up environments, the best tunic tops for leggings will hit below the waist. These tops also come in all different sorts of styles and shapes.</p><h2>How To Style Tunic Tops</h2><p>Ahead, you'll find 23 stylish tunics that are perfect for <a href=# class=T3D>pairing with leggings</a>, but most of them will look great with jeans and denim cutoffs, too; some can even be worn as beach cover-ups or dresses. (Some styling tips: Try pairing the former with a <a href=# class=T3D>sun hat</a> and sandals, or dress up the latter with statement earrings and heels.) The beauty of the general tunic-and-legging combo is that it works with just about any type of footwear: <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>chunky sandals</a> in the summer, sneakers for more casual occasions, and boots in the fall. And for those tunics that are extra-long and billowy, you can give them some shape by cinching them at the waist with a belt.</p><p>All of the best tunic tops featured ahead are available on Amazon Fashion, and most of them cost less than $30 (though you will find some luxury picks from brands like Free People and Vince for equal measure).

While it definitely lends itself well to wearing with leggings and other tight pants, it also looks cute with denim cutoffs in the warmer months. (As you can see in the pictures, it looks great with mini skirts, too). When you’re home, it’s comfy enough to cozy up in.</p><ul><li>Available sizes: Small — XX-Large</li><li>Available colors: 20</li></ul><p><strong>According to one Amazon reviewer:</strong> “I love this top, it is perfect paired with leggings, super soft and warm. It hugs the lower part of your arms which I love and [is] loose on the rest of me. I plan to buy in other colors due to the versatility of the top. Wear alone or throw on a blazer over it or a cute belt to dress it up. The neck line fits like a boat neck top. I highly recommend.”</p></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="wW_ GTB">19</h2><h2 class="i7p XE2">The Softest, Lightest Tunic Tee With A Flowy Fit</h2></p><p>Perfect for the summer months, whether worn with leggings, white jeans, or denim cutoffs, this long, flowy <a href=# rel=noreferrer>T-shirt</a> is made of Daily Ritual’s signature, super-soft jersey fabric. Get one for lounging in, too — trust us: this is one super-comfy top worth buying in multiples.</p><ul><li>Available sizes: X-Small — XX-Large</li><li>Available colors/prints: 18</li></ul><p><strong>According to one Amazon reviewer:</strong> “Fits perfectly, very soft, washes and dries in machines, and perfect cut. It’s nice and long so it’s perfect with leggings and the way it comes up higher on the sides makes it NOT feel like you’re just wearing a giant tshirt. Will buy more when more colors are available in my size.”</p></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="wW_ GTB">20</h2><h2 class="i7p XE2">This Casual, But Stylish, Tunic With A Criss-Cross Detail</h2></p><p>A criss-cross detail at the neckline and a twist detail at the hem set this otherwise simple <a href=# rel=noreferrer>tunic</a> apart from the rest. Ideal for casual wear, it also comes in a few color-blocked prints, as well as a short-sleeve version. This is a popular pick on Amazon, with over 4,000 five-star ratings (and counting).</p><ul><li>Available sizes: Small — XX-Large</li><li>Available styles: 28</li></ul><p><strong>According to one Amazon reviewer:</strong> “Oh my gosh - the perfect comfy, all-day top for leggings/jeggings. [...] Ended up buying in 4 colors. Have washed one already, no shrinkage. Thank you, Amazon!”</p></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="wW_ GTB">21</h2><h2 class="i7p XE2">A Lace-Trimmed Blouse That’s Longer In The Back</h2></p><p>This pretty little <a href=# rel=noreferrer>tunic</a>, like so many others on this list, can be styled with leggings, tight jeans, and denim shorts. But this one has a slightly dressier feel, thanks to the lace trim adorning the hem, which is what makes it stand out from the rest. Made of 95% rayon and 5% spandex, it’s super stretchy and soft — not to mention versatile.</p><ul><li>Available sizes: Small — XX-Large</li><li>Available styles: 37</li></ul><p><strong>According to one Amazon reviewer:</strong> “What a beautiful top! I love the length, style, and the lace crochet trim. This top is great to wear with leggings due to the length and it is super soft! I would highly recommend it.

This top, like the one above, is also made of rayon and spandex, so it’s super stretchy and easy to move in. Over 6,000 Amazon shoppers are fans.</p><ul><li>Available sizes: Small — XX-Large</li><li>Available colors/prints: 26</li></ul><p><strong>According to one Amazon reviewer:</strong> “Not only beautiful, but so comfortable as well.
