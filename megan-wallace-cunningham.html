Sadly, fans do not get the chance to congratulate her on her birthday since the star is mum on her exact birth date. After a deep digging and inspection of her past, we came to know that she is a direct descendant of John Adams and his wife, Abigail Adams. Adam who? Well, John is one of the Founding Fathers of the United States.</p><p>Cunningham often keeps her private affairs to herself and does not share her family matters in front of the media. She comes from a wealthy background, and some sources also revealed that her family owned a farm in Chester.</p><p>However, we do have some facts that can help you know your beloved Megan a bit more. Age, ethnicity, religious background and eye colour often rank higher in internet queries. Well, the America-native is 48 years old and shares white ancestry. She has mesmerizing brown eyes and brown hair colour to complement the whole look like a cherry on top. From the looks of it, she does have a decent height.</p><p>Megan Wallace completed her early education and graduated from Vermont.</p><p>We have nothing about her educational credentials or degrees. Until the star enlightens us on her upbringing, the void shall remain as it is. Megan is a successful art dealer by profession, and this fact alone proves her quality of education. Coming from a wealthy background, she must have received teachings from a top-notch tutor or institution.</p><h3><span id=Megan_Wallace_Cunninghams_Net_Worth><strong>Megan Wallace Cunningham’s Net Worth</strong></span></h3><p><img fetchpriority=high decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.webofbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Megan-Wallace-Cunningham-Net-Worth.jpg alt="Megan Wallace Cunningham Net Worth" width=700 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Exact figures or not, Megan is living a lavish life. As we already know, she has robust financial support from her family in Chester. Also, the woman is successful in her art dealing career. It is estimated that the businesswoman holds an estimated net worth of $1.3 million statistics.</p><p>To top that, she is the current wife of TV personality Craig Ferguson. Craig is a wealthy guy and has a luxurious life of his own. He boasts an impressive amount of $30 million, with $8.5 million as his annual income. These numbers inevitably increase his wife’s total revenue, too. Megan’s net worth is yet to surface on the internet, but it will come with a little increment on the previous numbers.</p><p>The family recently listed their Hollywood Hills house for $5.199 million. The home sat on two-thirds of an acre and was built roughly 115 years ago. With several rooms and outdoor space, the house expands across a 6,812 square feet area.</p><h3><span id=Some_Famous_Profiles_You_Should_Know_About><strong>Some Famous Profiles You Should Know About</strong></span></h3><h3><span id=Megan_Wallace_Cunningham_TV_Personality_Craig_Ferguson><strong>Megan Wallace Cunningham & TV Personality Craig Ferguson</strong></span></h3><p>The popularity of Megan roots back to her marriage with Craig Ferguson. The two first met in 2005 and started dating. Taking their relationship to the next level, the couple exchanged their holy vows on the 21st of December 2008. Despite the popularity of her husband, they decided to keep their ceremony rather private. Only fifteen guests attended the event, which included close friends and family members. The event took place in Megan’s home town Chester, Vermont.</p><p>Together, the couple shares a son named Liam James Ferguson. Craig and Megan had announced their expecting baby in July of 2010. The baby boy opened his eyes on 31st January 2011 with a healthy physical condition. Liam is the duo’s first child.</p><p>Megan and Craig have had a stable marital relationship since their marriage. Ferguson is still fighting against his alcohol addiction to this day, and his wife is there to help him. However, it took two other breakups for the TV personality to settle down finally. Before this association, he was married to two beautiful ladies. His first marriage dates back to 1983 when he started his official relationship with Ann Hogarth.</p><h3 class=qu><span id=Megan_Wallace_Cunningham_is_an_American_art_dealer>Megan Wallace Cunningham is an American art dealer.</span></h3><p>Ann is a graphic designer by profession. Other details on the woman are hard to find, but the two shared their romantic timeline until 1986. The two parted ways due to some issues in the relationship, and do not share any children.</p><p>Just two years after his divorce, Craig started his marital life with Sacha Ferguson. With the hopes of a new beginning, he tied the knot with the actress/bodybuilder. The couple stayed together until 2004 and parted ways. Both of them did not comment on the reason behind their sad breakup. The only thing that connects them to this day is their son, Milo Hamish. Milo lives near Craig’s house located in Chester.</p><h3><span id=Some_Details_on_Craig_Ferguson-Husband_of_Megan_Wallace_Cunningham><strong>Some Details on Craig Ferguson-Husband of Megan Wallace Cunningham</strong></span></h3><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.webofbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Megan-Wallace-Cunningham-Husband.jpg alt="Megan Wallace Cunningham Husband" width=696 height=870 sizes="(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Megan Wallace Cunningham with Husband Craig Ferguson.</p><p>Craig celebrates his birthday on 17th May each year. Born in 1962 in Scotland, UK, he is one of the most sought-after TV personalities of this time. His parents are Janet and Robert Ferguson. The future big shot attended Muirfield Primary School and chose Cumbernauld High School as his next educational station.</p><p>Surprisingly, he left his high school and initiated his apprenticeship as an electronics technician at the young age of 16. It was in the early 1980s that the man started his career in the entertainment business as a musician. At that time, he was a member of a punk band called The Bastards from Hell. The naming sense of 80s kids, though!</p><p>Leaving all these behind, the young man transferred to the US in 1983 and held several jobs during his struggle days. From the construction business to a bouncer in a nightclub, the man had his share of trouble back in the day. He finally eliminated the jinx with his appearance in “The Drew Carey Show” as Mr Wick. This incident became a sort of turning point for the man.</p><p>Fast forward to several years later, and the man established himself as a memorable actor. He grabbed the credits for several movies in the process, like Trust Me (2007), The Ugly Truth (2009), and “How To Train Your Dragon” franchise.
