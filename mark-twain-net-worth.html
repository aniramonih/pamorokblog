This wealth was amassed through his prolific writing career, spanning genres like humor, satire, and American realism, and his engaging lecture tours.</p><p>Comparatively, <strong>Ernest Hemingway</strong> and <strong>William Faulkner</strong>, two other literary giants, had different financial trajectories. Hemingway, known for his adventurous lifestyle and Nobel Prize in Literature, had a net worth estimated at about $1 million at the time of his death.</p><p>Faulkner, another Nobel laureate, had a net worth estimated at around <strong>$500,000</strong>, similar to Twain’s.

His early years in Hannibal, Missouri, shaped much of his future writing.
