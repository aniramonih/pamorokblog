He has also starred in movies like “American History X,” “Detroit Rock City,” and “Pet Sematary Two.”</p><p>In 2019, Furlong returned to the Terminator franchise with a role in “Terminator: Dark Fate,” alongside Linda Hamilton. However, his personal life has been troubled, with numerous arrests and stays in rehab making headlines in recent years.</p><h2><span id=Early_Life_and_Career>Early Life and Career</span></h2><p>Edward Walker Furlong was born on August 2nd, 1977 in Glendale California. He was discovered by the casting director for James Cameron’s “Terminator 2: Judgement Day” while sitting outside on the steps of the Pasadena Boys and Girls Club in September of 1990. Eddie was just thirteen when he was offered the role of John Connor alongside Arnold Schwarzenegger in “Terminator 2: Judgement Day.”</p><p>Prior to being offered the role, he hadn’t considered acting as a career, and it complicated his already tumultuous home life. After she separated from his stepfather, Furlong’s mother let him live with her sister and brother-in-law. They were awarded guardianship in 1991 and initially served as his managers. While he was working on “Terminator 2: Judgement Day,” his mother and aunt were engaged in a bitter custody dispute.</p><h2><span id=Awards_and_Recognition>Awards and Recognition</span></h2><p>For his performance in “Terminator 2: Judgement Day,” he won an MTV Movie Award for Best Breakthrough Role in addition to a Saturn Award for Best Young Actor.</p><h2><span id=Legal_and_Financial_Disputes>Legal and Financial Disputes</span></h2><p>After the film’s release, Furlong’s mother and aunt were still his legal guardians and maintained that they were not receiving enough of his money to support the lifestyle of a star. Their financial disputes with his attorney continued until his mother finally regained custody in 1994.</p><h2><span id=Edward_Furlongs_Troubled_Home_Life_and_Legal_Battles>Edward Furlong’s Troubled Home Life and Legal Battles</span></h2><p>Edward Furlong’s salary for Terminator 2 was $75,000, equivalent to $150,000 today. However, the money brought more troubles to his already-troubled home life. During filming, Edward’s mother, sister, and uncle fought for custody and control of the young actor’s bank account. The uncle claimed to have gone into debt attempting to keep up with Edward’s newfound fame.</p><p>Edward’s tutor, Jacqueline Louise Domac, was later revealed to have begun a sexual relationship with him when he was 14, and they moved in together. His uncle attempted to have her prosecuted for statutory rape, but was unsuccessful. In 1999, Domac sued Furlong for domestic abuse.</p><p>Producers of “Brainscan” claimed that Edward and his aunt and uncle were constantly fighting on set, leading to their banishment and his mother’s reinstatement as legal guardian. Edward and his tutor subsisted off a $2,500 monthly allowance from a court-appointed manager.</p><h2><span id=Edward_Furlongs_Acting_Career>Edward Furlong’s Acting Career</span></h2><p>Edward Furlong began his acting career in 1991 with the lead role in “Terminator 2: Judgment Day,” which was a massive commercial success. He went on to star in “Pet Sematary Two,” “American Hearts,” “A Home of Our Own,” “Little Odessa,” and “Brainscan.” In 1998, he was cast in his most critically acclaimed film “American History X” alongside Edward Norton, but it performed poorly at the box office. He continued to act in television films throughout the 2000s, with notable roles in “The Crow: Wicked Prayer,” “Jimmy and Judy,” and “Night of the Demons” remake. In 2011, he had a supporting role in “The Green Hornet,” which was a moderate commercial success. In 2019, he reprised his role as John Connor for the sequel “Terminator: Dark Fate,” but he was only on set for one day because Connor was killed off in the opening scene.</p><h2><span id=Personal_Struggles_of_Edward_Furlong>Personal Struggles of Edward Furlong</span></h2><p>Edward Furlong, like many child actors, faced a number of personal issues as he entered the entertainment industry without proper support. He struggled with alcoholism, heroin, and cocaine addiction, and sought treatment in rehab in 2000.</p><p>In 2006, Furlong married Rachel Bella, and the couple had a son together. However, in 2009, Bella filed for divorce and revealed that their son had tested positive for cocaine and that Furlong had been physically abusive towards her. She filed for a restraining order in September of that year after he punched her in the face.</p><p>In 2012, Furlong was arrested for felony domestic violence after assaulting his then girlfriend Monica Keena. He was arrested again for assaulting her in November of that year and once more in January of 2013. He was later sentenced to 180 days in jail. He was arrested for assaulting his next girlfriend in May of 2013, and he avoided prison by agreeing to five years of probation, one year of domestic violence classes, and 90 days of rehab.</p><p>After these incidents and their consequences, Furlong finally committed to sobriety and has occasionally accompanied Keena at fan meet and greets.</p><h2>You May Also Like</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiopaG9ta3SraCcZpOkunCxw7CYq5xdm8KzuM6nnmamlal6uLvRrZ9o</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fedward-furlong-net-worth.html&text=Edward%20Furlong%20Net%20Worth%20-%20Pulptastic&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fedward-furlong-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fedward-furlong-net-worth.html&title=Edward%20Furlong%20Net%20Worth%20-%20Pulptastic" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fedward-furlong-net-worth.html&title=Edward%20Furlong%20Net%20Worth%20-%20Pulptastic" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fedward-furlong-net-worth.html&title=Edward%20Furlong%20Net%20Worth%20-%20Pulptastic" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fedward-furlong-net-worth.html&description=Edward%20Furlong%20Net%20Worth%20-%20Pulptastic" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./elijah-kelley-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Elijah Kelley Net Worth">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./does-selena-gomez-wear-glasses.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Does Selena Gomez Wear Glasses?">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
