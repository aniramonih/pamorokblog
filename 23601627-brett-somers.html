As you wrote, it was believed that they separated but never divorced. However, supposedly California records indicate they were divorced in 1977, about three years after they separated. Jack Klugman lived with his girlfriend Peggy Crosby for 20 years. He only married Peggy the year after Brett died. Brett said in interviews that they were not officially divorced. I often wonder if their lawyers finalized their divorce but somehow that never got back to Jack or Brett, although they'd have to have signed the papers.</p><table class="info small"><tr><td class=by>by <span>Anonymous</span></td><td class=count>reply 7</td><td class=timestamp><span>April 12, 2019 5:15 PM</span></td></tr></table><p>That's interesting, I had no idea they actually had divorced.

Maybe it wasn't apparent in the days when the shows first appeared, but watching it now it's hard not to feel embarrassed for her. What a psychological mess she was. What we'd call now an attention whore.</p><p>Yet she was (reportedly) good friends with Marcia Wallace, Charles Nelson Reilly , and Fanny Flagg; all of whom seem stable in comparison.</p><p>I wonder if, by the end, they all hated each other.

So Richard stayed until the bitter end, but he was very nasty and unfriendly and stopped cracking jokes or participating.

Granted, Chita probably has never said a mean word about anybody, but having known Charles back in the 1990's when he was focusing on directing, I bet he went out there and made it through pure determination. Charles was a very kind man who got me house seats (comp!) for "The Gin Game" which he directed. I will never forget that. He went out of his way to contact me right before I left L.A. for New York and gave instructions of how to claim my seats AND take my friend backstage to meet both Julie Harris and Charles Durning after the show.

She would have been a fun panelist. I see that she appeared on a few game shows. Charles Nelson Reilly directed her in an Off Broadway revival of "Private Lives". I sensed when I mentioned Stritch in a conversation with him that he had issues with her, because his eyes lightly rolled, and we moved onto the subject of another actress. She mentioned in an interview that she had worked with some lousy directors, but I doubt they were lousy. They just couldn't control her, especially with her own drinking habit. Actually, Eileen Heckart or Grayson Hall or Selma Diamond or Carrie Nye (all baritone babes) would have been fun on the show, too.</p><table class="info small"><tr><td class=by>by <span>Anonymous</span></td><td class=count>reply 122</td><td class=timestamp><span>April 15, 2019 4:55 PM</span></td></tr></table><p>GAME SHOW panelists?

She sat next to me, and I realized it was Brett Somers. I was a big fan, so of course I had to tell her how much I admired her. She seemed genuinely surprised and touched that I recognized her.

He directed her in several plays, including her Tony nominated performance in "The Gin Game" w/Charles Durning. It says a lot about theater actors when they can do a game show or soap opera (as many New York theater actors did when they couldn't find a play to do) that they'll do these types of parts.</p><table class="info small"><tr><td class=by>by <span>Anonymous</span></td><td class=count>reply 129</td><td class=timestamp><span>April 15, 2019 5:28 PM</span></td></tr></table><p>It always irritated me that Dicky Dawson got picked so often by contestants when Charles was really good at the game, too.</p><table class="info small"><tr><td class=by>by <span>Anonymous</span></td><td class=count>reply 130</td><td class=timestamp><span>April 15, 2019 5:30 PM</span></td></tr></table><p>R129, I'm well aware of their history but the concept was that TT often had gay men/lesbians on the show as couples.</p><table class="info small"><tr><td class=by>by <span>Anonymous</span></td><td class=count>reply 131</td><td class=timestamp><span>April 15, 2019 5:30 PM</span></td></tr></table><p>I would come home from elementary school and watch this show like it was so important.
