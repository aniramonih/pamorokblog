Aside from starring in several spin-off shows and prequels of the “Twin Peaks” franchise, Dana is also widely recognized for appearing in movies such as “Bonnie & Clyde: The True Story” (1992), “The Last Place on Earth” (2002) and “The Aggression Scale” (2012) as well as in TV series including “Crisis Center”, “Dawson’s Creek”, “The Kill Point” and “Crash” among plenty of others.</p><h2><span id=Dana_Ashbrook8217s_Early_Life>Dana Ashbrook’s Early Life</span></h2><p>Dana Vernon Ashbrook was born under the zodiac sign of Gemini on the 24th May 1967, in San Diego, California, USA, of American nationality and white ethnicity, one of three children to teacher and amateur actress D’Ann Paton, and actor and Palomar College’s Drama Department director Vernon L. ‘Buddy’ Ashbrook. Dana has two sisters – Taylor Ashbrook who is an actress, director and writer, and Daphne Ashbrook who is an actress as well. Originating from a family with such a rich history in the movie-making industry, it is no wonder that Dana has managed to make a successful acting career himself. Details regarding Ashbrook’s educational background haven’t been publicly disclosed to the present day.</p><h2><span id=Dana_Ashbrook8217s_Career>Dana Ashbrook’s Career</span></h2><p>Although Dana began his acting career at the early age of 11, with an uncredited appearance in the 1978 horror comedy movie “Attack of the Killer Tomatoes!”, his real acting debut occurred in 1987 when he appeared in an episode of the “Cagney & Lacey” TV series. In the course of the next several years, Dana honed his acting skills through a streak of various roles in TV series such as “Knots Landing” and “21 Jump Street”, as well as in movies including “Return of the Living Dead II” and “Waxwork” both in 1988, and in the 1989 western comedy horror movie “Sundown: The Vampire in Retreat”.</p><p></p><p>The real breakthrough in Dana Ashbrook’s acting career occurred in 1990, when he was cast for the recurring role of Bobby Briggs in Mark Frost’s and David Lynch’s masterpiece TV series “Twin Peaks”. The plot follows the investigation of a homecoming queen’s murder in the fictional town of Twin Peaks, and is abundant with supernatural elements and eccentric characters. Despite its short-term run of only two seasons originally, the series quickly earned cult status with the audience, and was honored with three Golden Globes, one Primetime Emmy Award and the Grammy Award. Dana reprised his portrayal of Bobby Briggs in the 1992 prequel movie “Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me”.</p><p>Later that year Dana starred alongside Tracey Needham, portraying Clyde Barrow in the crime drama movie “Bonnie & Clyde: The True Story”. In 1997 he was cast for the recurring role of Officer Gary McDermott in the “Crisis Center” TV series, while in 2002 he appeared in the leading role of Rob Baskin in the comedy drama movie “The Last Place on Earth”. Between 2002 and 2003, Dana Ashbrook appeared in the recurring role of Rich Rinaldi in the “Dawson’s Creek” TV series, which was followed by a streak of guest appearances in television series such as “Deadwood” and “Law & Order: Special Victims Unit”.
