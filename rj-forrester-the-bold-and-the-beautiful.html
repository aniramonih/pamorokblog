The next day, Ridge told Brooke that he was meant to be with her.</p><p>Since the show started in 1987, Ridge and Brooke have had 11 weddings and been legally married seven times, according to Soaps.com.</p><p>Ridge has been with many other women, but only Brooke and Taylor have given him children. After Brooke had children with several other men, including Ridge’s father Eric (John McCook), she finally had a son with Ridge, whom she named Ridge Jr.</p><p>But RJ, as his friends and family call him, hasn’t been seen since 2018, making viewers wonder where he is, especially now that Brooke and Taylor have both broken up with Ridge, put an end to their famous feud, and are slowly becoming best friends.</p><h3>RJ was a teenager when he left the show</h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/rj-was-a-teenager-when-he-left-the-show-1676288189.jpg alt="is rj forrester coming back,what happened to jack marone bold and beautiful,what happened to r j forrester on the bold and the beautiful,r j forrester age,r j forrester and coco spectra,who is rj forrester,what happened to eric forrester jr,what happened to coco on bold and beautiful,r.j.&amp;#039;&amp;#039; forrester age,r.j. forrester and coco spectra,what happened to r.j. forrester on the bold and the beautiful,where is rj forrester on the bold and the beautiful,who is rj on bold and the beautiful" width=780 height=438 sizes="(max-width: 780px) 100vw, 780px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>When Brooke was pregnant with RJ, she didn’t know who the baby’s father was. She thought Ridge’s half-brother Nick Marone was the father because she had slept with him when she thought Ridge had died in a freak <a href=#>accident</a> and she needed comfort. But later, a paternity test showed that Ridge was, in fact, the baby’s real father. Soaps.com says that Brooke named their first child together Ridge. During his childhood, RJ was often talked about but rarely seen. For example, he and his sister accidentally started a fire in their mother’s house, which made Ridge want to take custody of them.</p><p>In 2016, Anthony Turpel, who played RJ when he was a teenager, went back to the Forrester Mansion to try to get his parents back together, even though Brooke was already engaged to someone else. RJ also fell in love with Coco Spectra, who was played by Courtney Grosbeck and was the great-niece of Sally Spectra, a family rival who had stolen fashion designs from the Forrester family in the past.</p><p>He persuaded Ridge to hire Coco as an intern, and he stood up for her when Spectra Fashions used her secret sketches to make clothes. The teens kept seeing each other, but they stopped being on the show not long after Ridge and Brooke got engaged again at a Thanksgiving party at Forrester Mansion. RJ is said to have gone back to boarding school, and he hasn’t been seen since.</p><h3>Anthony Turpel moved onto another show</h3>View this post on Instagram<p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none href=# rel=noopener>A post shared by Anthony Turpel (@anthony_turpel)</a></p><p>Soap Opera News says that actor Anthony Turpel was let out of his contract when the writers of “The Bold and the Beautiful” decided to take the Spectra family out of all future stories. As Coco’s love interest, RJ seemed to have no idea what to do, so he was sent away to school. The last time we saw the character was in 2018, but Turpel hasn’t gone away.</p><p>In 2020, he got a part on the hit Hulu streaming show “Love, Victor,” which was a spinoff of the popular gay drama “Love, Simon.”</p><p>Felix is the neighbor of the show’s main character and his best friend. Turpel plays Felix. In the summer of 2014, actress Katherine Kelly Lang retweeted a fan who wanted RJ to come back to “B&B” and wrote, “That would be nice to have RJ back.” This made fans even more interested in RJ’s return.</p><p>As Ridge and Brooke’s only child, RJ’s growing up could add a lot of new drama to the show, especially if he tried to break up the most popular couple, Taylor and Brooke.</p><a class=m-a-box-avatar-url href=#><img width=150 height=150 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/logo-Finale.png alt="is rj forrester coming back,what happened to jack marone bold and beautiful,what happened to r j forrester on the bold and the beautiful,r j forrester age,r j forrester and coco spectra,who is rj forrester,what happened to eric forrester jr,what happened to coco on bold and beautiful,r.j.'' forrester age,r.j. forrester and coco spectra,what happened to r.j. forrester on the bold and the beautiful,where is rj forrester on the bold and the beautiful,who is rj on bold and the beautiful" itemprop=image style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a><h5><a class=m-a-box-name-url href=#>DCS</a></h5><a href=# class=m-a-box-data-toggle><span class=m-a-box-string-more-posts>+ posts</span></a><p>Our Team DCS includes 5 different writers proficient in English and research based Content Writing.
