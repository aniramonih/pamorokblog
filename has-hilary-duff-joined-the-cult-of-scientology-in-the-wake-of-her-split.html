Hilary has an uncanny ability to get papped at a level that is in no way consistent with her mild amount of fame. So that means that her moves are also examined in a way that doesn’t seem warranted, given her career. The sleuths over at Radar Online have noticed that Hilary is hanging out with lifelong Scientologist, Alanna Masterson, (Chris and Danny Masterson’s sister) and that she’s been sporting a temporary tattoo that is a mishmash of Scientology symbols. So will Hilary eventually get to know Xenu? (After she either pays a million dollars or does <a href=#>a Google search</a>?) Here’s what Radar says:</p><p>The actress has been spotted hanging with the Young Hollywood Scientology crowd in the weeks since announcing her split, RadarOnline.com has learned, and even rocking a temporary tattoo with Scientology symbols!</p><p>Duff recently hit up the Coachella music festival with longtime friend — and super Scientologist — Alanna Masterson.</p><p>Rumored to have recently dated Tom Cruise’s son Connor Cruise, Masterson has been a member of the Church most of her life, along with her brothers Chris Masterson and Danny Masterson…</p><p>Masterson’s dad, Joe Reaiche, has since left the church, and recently spoke out about his concern for how deeply Masterson is enmeshed in it.</p><p>“I paid for my kids to go to private Scientology school but it’s a total fraud,” he said. “…Recently Alanna gave them $25,000 because they told her they could give her superpowers. That’s on top of the normal 50 to 100 grand a year she pays in fees.”</p><p>Could she be sharing her beliefs with Duff? The actress was spotted rocking a mysterious temporary tattoo during the girls’ time together at Coachella — and it included Scientology symbols!</p><p>At the center of the doodle was a small triangle, a symbol of “the utmost importance” in Scientology, according to the church’s official website. Known as the “ARC” or “Affinity, Reality and Communication” triangle, it “greatly assists interpersonal relationships,” according to Scientology.org, and gives Scientologists “a greater understanding of life itself.”</p><p>Another important triangle in Scientology is the KRC Triangle, which represents “Knowledge, Responsibility and Control.” Finally, the symbol for Dianetics, the church “technology” that helps the mind “overcome [the reactive mind[ and reach the state of Clear,” according to the Scientology website. As such, triangles are to be found throughout Scientology literature.</p><p>In addition to the triangle, Duff also appeared to be inked up with a tiny rendition of an image similar to the Scientology cross — a cross with tiny diagonal rays between the horizontal and vertical arms. This is the symbol most frequently used to represent the church.</p><p>Duff’s temporary tat was not visible when she stepped out in L.A. days later.</p><p><a href=#>[From Radar Online]</a></p><p>Hilary and Alana posted that boob-grabbing Instagram to show off that tattoo, they knew what they were doing. Whether Hilary knew exactly what it meant is up to question though. The photo is from two months ago so maybe it was just a goof. You would think that Hilary would be seen visiting the Scientology centre or something in the interim if this was true, but we’ll see.</p><p>This is going to sound mean, but Duff seems gullible enough to get involved with a cult if one of her buddies tells her it’s the thing to do. Hopefully if she’s dabbling she’ll do a cursory google search and realize what a terrible mistake that would be. She surely reads the celebrity blogs, she has to know what Leah Remini has been going through at the very least. I’m sure the Scientologists tell ridiculous smear stories about Leah and all the people who have the wherewithal to get out though. (They make idiotic websites against their enemies after all.) It seems like anyone who gets involved with Scientology at this point has to be willfully ignorant of all their abuses. That’s why celebrities are particularly targetable, many of them are comfortable in their little bubbles.</p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/wenn21296743_edited-1-682x1024.jpg alt="Hilary Duff leaving the gym" width=500 sizes="(max-width: 682px) 100vw, 682px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/FFN_Duff_Hilary_MAL_042114_51390021_edited-1-767x1024.jpg alt="Hilary Duff Out And About In Beverly Hills" width=500 sizes="(max-width: 767px) 100vw, 767px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/FFN_Duff_Hilary_VM_EXC_042514_51393808_edited-1-731x1024.jpg alt="Hilary Duff Stops By Coffee Bean" width=500 sizes="(max-width: 731px) 100vw, 731px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>All of these photos of Hilary are from last week, except the header.
