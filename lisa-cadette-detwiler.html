Whatsoever, she is best known as the wife of a prominent host, <strong>Jim Cramer</strong>. Currently, he hosts <i>"Mad Money With Jim Cramer"</i> which is a weekday show aired on <i>CNBC</i>.</p><p>Lisa Cadette was born in 1965 in Millbrook, New York, USA. Further, she belongs to a white ethnic background, and her nationality is American. Besides her bio and professional life, people are more curious to know about her married life with Jim.</p><h2>Married Life With Jim Cramer</h2><p>The beautiful broker, Lisa Cadette, is happily married to her husband, <strong>Jim Cramer</strong>, who is a popular author and TV personality who currently host a weekday show named "<i>Mad Money With Jim Cramer</i>." The two walked down the aisle on <i>18 April 2015</i>, which was officiated by their archaeologist friend, <strong>Aran Yardeni</strong>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2019/12/10/Capture-1575969419299.PNG><p>They exchanged their wedding vows in front of their close friends and relatives at the Liberty Warehouse in Brooklyn. Well, the pair first met in 2006 at a Manhattan bar on a date that was set up by a mutual friend.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2019/12/10/Jim%20Cramer%20Wife-1575969552127.jpg><p>In an <a href=#>interview with the New York Times</a>, she said,</p><p>"I remember saying that there was no way I was going to go out with that bald, screaming man," (laughing). "But then the person who set us up reminded me that I had been spending too much time at home watching television with my dog."</p><p>It's been 12 years of their togetherness and four years of their marriage, and still, the lovey-dovey is living blissfully without any kind of divorce rumours and controversies regarding their love life.</p><h2>Previous Relationships And Affairs</h2><p>Before marrying Jim, she was in a marital relationship with a mysterious guy. To date, she has been tight-lipped about her first marriage details. It seems like she does not want to reveal her past to the public yet.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2019/12/10/Karen%20Backfisch%20Olufsen%20age,%20wiki,%20biography-1575969298811.png><p>On the other hand, her husband, Jim, was also previously in a marital relationship with<strong> Karen Backfisch. </strong>His ex-partner is a professional stock market expert. The two were married in 1988 and later divorced in 2009.</p><h2>Children From Her Previous Marriage</h2><p>Lisa shares three children from her first marriage. And she shared her life tragedy with the NY Times as one of her two-year-old daughters died because of cardiomyopathy. Likewise, she also shares her life tragedy with Jim on their first date, and he is overwhelmed by her shocking life moment.</p><p>Following her tragedy, he said to the NY Times,&nbsp;</p><p>"I'm looking at this woman who just shared with me this horrible tragedy that happened in her life, and I'm thinking to myself, how does she even have the strength to get up in the morning?"</p><p>During their 21 years of marital life, the ex-couple shares two children. As a matter of fact, Lisa and Jim met each other when they were in the same life condition. The two were divorced from their spouses and searching for a new one. For now, the two families have merged into one and living blissfully as a family.</p><h2>The Net Worth Of Lisa Cadette Detwiler</h2><p>Cadette is one of the well-known real estate brokers, such as <a href=#><strong>Linette Semino</strong></a>; Lisa has earned a hefty sum of money through her successful career.
