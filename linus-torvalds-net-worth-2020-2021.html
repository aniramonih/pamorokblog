Well, if you’re ready, let’s start.</p><h2>Early Life</h2><p>Linus Torvalds was born on December 28, 1969, in Helsinki, Finland. His father, Nils Torvalds, and mother, Anna Torvalds, were both journalists. He comes from a family of highly qualified academics.

Together the couple has three kids, Patricia, Celeste, and Daniela. Linus considers himself an atheist and believes that religion should be a personal choice and not a political issue.</p><p>In 2010, Linus Torvalds became the citizen of the United States of America and registered himself to vote in the States.</p><h2>Age, Height, and Weight</h2><p>Being born on 28 December 1969, Linus Torvalds is 54 years old as of today’s date 21st July 2024.

The first prototype of Linux was released in 1991, but the full version, i.e., LINUX Version 1.0, was released in 1994.</p><p>Linus then started working at the Transmeta in California, where he served the company for almost six years. He joined the Open Source Development Labs (OSDL). OSDL then merged with Free Standards Group to become the Linus Foundation. He started working on the file format that can be used on the common x86 PC. He called it ’86open’ project, which is a binary file format for the Unix and Unix-like operating system.</p><p>After the success with his creations, Linus was offered stocks in the companies, Red Hat and VA Linux. Some might call it lucky; the same year, when he received the stocks, the price of the stocks shoot up to $20 million after both the companies went public. It was the situation where success was following Linus Torvalds.</p><p>Linus then shifted to Oregon with his family. He bought a house in Beaverton, Oregon, close to the headquarters of Open Source Development Labs. Everything was perfect for Linus in Oregon, and after shifting to his new house, soon, he came up with the software called Git. According to the reports, about two percent of the Linux Kernel was written by him, which is a big deal in the software industry.</p><h2>Awards & Achievements</h2><p>Linus Torvalds has achieved a lot of awards in his life for his contribution to computers and technology.
