Their relationship was filled with so much controversy from the beginning. Stacey’s sister Stacey was not comfortable with the fact that he was allegedly after her sister’s money.</p><p>Moreso, Darcey felt that Florian was only with her sister because he wanted to gain a green card. As a result, Stacey’s sister took some time before she warmed to her sister’s better half. Sukaj and Stacey dated for five years during which time Stacey visited Albania eight times. Shortly after he got cleared, they got married on April 20, 2020.</p><p>Shockingly, through the back and forth of planning their marriage, he was cheating on Stacey. He later confessed to her after they had gotten married.</p><p>Though at the time, she was disappointed by the infidelity, she later claimed it strengthened their relationship.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=All_The_Details_We_Found_Out_About_Florian_Sukaj></span><strong>All The Details We Found Out About Florian Sukaj</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/jukebugs.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Florian-F1.jpg><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=1_He_Is_An_Albanian></span><strong>1. He Is An Albanian</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Sukaj came to the US from his native Albania. Even though he found success and fame in front of the big screen he has a long interesting life that started outside the American shores.</p><p>Reportedly, he traveled to the United States of America on a K-1 Visa, enabling him to marry within 90 days of arriving in the country.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=2_Florian_Sukaj_Is_A_Man_Of_Many_Caps></span><strong>2. Florian Sukaj Is A Man Of Many Caps</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Florian is a social butterfly and knows how to pull the crowd in. Based on his Instagram bio he is a fashion and fitness model. According to the reality TV star and his wife, Stacey he also works as an influencer.</p><p>Going further, his wife buttressed the point about her husband’s work to say that he is a ‘jack of all trades’ as a result of his sharp eye for designing furniture.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=3_His_Wife_And_Her_Sister_Wanted_To_Have_A_Twin_wedding></span><strong>3. His Wife And Her Sister Wanted To Have A Twin wedding</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Following the breakup of Darcy’s relationship with her then-fiance, Georgi Rusev, it was quite disappointing for the twins who had specials for their big day. They had planned to have a double wedding by getting married to the men of their dreams on the same day.</p><p>Unfortunately, such grand plans never materialized as the Darcey-Rusev pair soon came crashing. They had broken off their relationship in the past before coming together.</p><p>Obviously, the second break-up was the final straw since they never reconciled again. Darcey confirmed their breakup on February 28, 2022.</p><h3><strong>4. The Albanian-Born Native Is The Step-Father Of Stacey Silvers’s Children</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Though they have been together for seven years as of this writing, the couple does not have any children of their own together. However, Florian became the stepfather to his wife’s two children, Parker and Mateo Vasic from a previous relationship.</p><p>Reportedly her two boys hardly appear on the reality show that their mother is well known for. However, Florian and Stacey once had a conversation about having children together yet it never happened after she discovered she had a cyst on her ovary.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=5_Florian_Sukaj_Is_Nearly_Twenty_Years_Younger_Than_His_Wife></span><strong>5.

Inasmuch as his birthday is not known, his wife Stacey is known to have been born on September 23, 1974.</p><p>Despite their age difference, they are still married after all these years.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=6_Florians_Wife_And_Her_Twin_Divorced_Their_Ex-husbands_On_The_Same_Day></span><strong>6.

Yet, their twinning has always been a part of their lives. The two are reported to have lived in the same house that their father bought it for them with their spouses and children.</p><p>Shockingly, when both of their former marriages started crumbling, they ended it on the same day. Their twin lifestyles go beyond this. Both women once went for ‘foreign men’ and tried to get married to them on the same day. Stacey was dating Florian while Darcey was dating Rusev hence the foreign tag.</p><p><strong>See Also:&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>90 Day Fiance Juliana- 10 Things You Don’t Know About Her</a></strong></p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=7_How_Did_He_Make_His_Net_Worth></span><strong>7.

He is stated to be the backbone of Florian’s wife and her sister’s success and that he once bought a house for them.</p><p>Notably, he likely got some of his earnings when he appeared on the TLC reality shows alongside his wife.
