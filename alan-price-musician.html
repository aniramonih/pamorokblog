In addition to this, he is also known for his solo work. He is one of the best keyboardists in music history.&nbsp;</p><p>Price’s contribution to The Animals’ music was one of the most important factors in the group’s worldwide success. As a matter of fact, his playing was one of the key reasons why the group's biggest hits, including ‘House of the Rising Sun’, has such legendary status.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Alan Price’s Marriages And Past Relationships</strong></h2><p>Tabloids do not have much information regarding Price’s marriages but according to some verified sources, he has been married twice.

The pair tied the knot in a ceremony at Fulham, together he and Maureen had one child together. They named their daughter <strong>Elizabeth</strong>.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2021/3/31/-1%20(48)-1617179930576.jpg><p>Further, he used to be a Rockstar but in comparison to most superstars, he had a pretty quiet personal life in the past. Rather than the rock and roll life he spent most of his youth focused on his career.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Price’s Career In The Animals</strong></h2><p>Alan started his music career back in 1961, he has been active in the industry for more than 6 decades. In that time, he has worked both as a solo musician and part of ensembles. The biggest act of his career was when he became part of The Animals.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2021/3/31/-1%20(49)-1617179995675.jpg><p>The band is famous for its legendary hit, ‘House of the Rising Sun’. Alan was integral in giving the song its eerie and psychedelic feel. Similarly, the star keyboardist was part of the group during various periods of the band’s existence.&nbsp;</p><p>While he is not a current member of the band in 2021, he has some solo projects which are pretty popular.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>What Is Alan Price’s Net Worth?</strong></h2><p>The keyboardist has a net worth of <strong>$4 million</strong> according to CelebrityNetWorth. He made most of his fortune from his musical career.&nbsp;</p><p>From his more than 6 decades in show business, he has been associated with various legendary acts. In addition to this, he has also had several chart-topping hits during his 60 years.&nbsp;</p><p>He is also charitable and is involved with the 'Foundation of Light' charitable organization. he has donated huge chunks of his wealth to various causes.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Alan Price’s Early Life & Age</strong></h2><p>Price was born on <strong>19 April 1942</strong> in Fatfield, Washington, <strong>Tyne </strong>and <strong>Wear England</strong>. He went to Jarrow Grammar School, he was interested in music and art right from an early age, but he does not have any formal music training.</p><p>As a matter of fact, Alan is a self-taught musician, which is hard to believe because of his almost inhuman talent. After getting his education, he did not pursue a traditional career, rather he opted to become a musician. &nbsp;Similar to him, <a href=#><strong>Finlay Munro Kemp</strong></a> is also a musician.</p><p><i><strong>Keep Loving </strong></i><a href=#><i><strong>Married Celeb</strong></i></a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmilkae%2FqrHDnJylnZJjsLC5jpqjmqZdpb%2Bqr8RmpK6rmZi2oro%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2falan-price-musician.html&text=Is%20The%20Legendary%20Musician%20Alan%20Price%20Married%3f%20How%20Many%20Children%20Does%20She%20Have%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2falan-price-musician.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2falan-price-musician.html&title=Is%20The%20Legendary%20Musician%20Alan%20Price%20Married%3f%20How%20Many%20Children%20Does%20She%20Have%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2falan-price-musician.html&title=Is%20The%20Legendary%20Musician%20Alan%20Price%20Married%3f%20How%20Many%20Children%20Does%20She%20Have%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2falan-price-musician.html&title=Is%20The%20Legendary%20Musician%20Alan%20Price%20Married%3f%20How%20Many%20Children%20Does%20She%20Have%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2falan-price-musician.html&description=Is%20The%20Legendary%20Musician%20Alan%20Price%20Married%3f%20How%20Many%20Children%20Does%20She%20Have%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./jj-and-tylee-autopsy-report.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="JJ and Tylee Autopsy Report: Forensic Pathologist Testifies">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./is-pampered-chef-stoneware-warranty-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Is Pampered Chef stoneware warranty?">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
