If you do not know, we have prepared this article about details of Clyde Lewis’s short biography-wiki, career, professional life, personal life, today’s net worth, age, height, weight, and more facts. Well, if you’re ready, let’s start.</p><h2>Early Life & Biography</h2><p>Clyde Lewis was born on 22 February 1964 in Utah, USA. He indicates that he has had a background in Mormonism, which he says influenced his work as a conspiracy theorist. It is within the Mormon faith system to query everything. As a missionary in Argentina, Clyde says he mat Satanists, witches communists, Muslims, and voodoo priests and witnessing telepathy and telekinesis, which stirred his explorations into different belief systems. He has been into three marriages.</p><h2>Personal Life</h2><p>Clyde was born in Utah. Clyde Lewis attended Kearns High School and graduated in 1982. His home town is South Lake City but later lives in Portland, Oregon. He has, however, lived in Buenos Aires in Argentina.</p><p>He indicates that in his childhood, Clyde would often play lousy guy roles. “I still think that in some ways, I look like a bad guy, but I am now playing heroes.”</p><p>Lewis has gone through three marriages and is currently married to Janine Duffy since 15 June 2016.</p><h2>Age, Height, and Weight</h2><p>Being born on 22 February 1964, Clyde Lewis is 60 years old as of today’s date 20th July 2024.

In 1982, Lewis’ first radio experience came in as a producer and engineer at KBBX, a gospel station in Bountiful, Utah.</p><p>He later became an LDS missionary in Argentina. He resumed his radio career, becoming the morning show producer for the top radio talent in Salt Lake City at K-LITE 93 FM. Later he joined CNN to create CNN Radio, which featured 24 hours of CNN broadcasts at Salts Lake City’s KCNR.</p><p>Lewis started Ground Zero, a show he hosted in 1995 at Salt Lake City. The show began as KULT Radio at KCNR, but one week later, pressure from those who disliked the name made him change it Ground Zero. This show addressed various scopes in political, paranormal, and entertainment topics. After two weeks, the bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City, he was pressured to change the name of the show, too, but he refused.</p><p>Lewis later moved the show to KBER, and it was the top-rated in its time slot in Salt Lake City. However, his remarks at the show on 25 March 1997 invited the FBI to investigate him after he indicated that the night marked by the new moon would be a great night for some cult to commit suicide. Coincidentally, on that night, Heaven’s Gate cult committed suicide at Rancho Santa Fe in California. Clyde had no connection with the cult, however.</p><p>In June 2001, the show lost its syndication after he claimed on air that Timothy McVeigh’s pending execution would result in a terrorist attack in the United States. He suggested that this could be stopped by keeping Timothy alive for longer to extract information from him about existing terrorist cells in the country.

It failed to capture the same energy as before and was subsequently canceled on 29 October 2010. A new bar was opened in Portland to showcase Lewis’s work in 2011.</p><p>Clyde has also appeared as a commentator on cable television on two shows: Outside the Box hosted by Alex Ansary and Mad as Hell hosted by Courtney Scott. These shows are both aired by Portland Community Media.</p><h2>Awards & Achievements</h2><p>Clyde has been a powerful voice in Commentary and Paranormal news.
