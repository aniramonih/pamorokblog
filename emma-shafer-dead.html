Deadly crimes like this are all too common in our world, but when it happens to someone in our own backyard, it hits close to home. In this article, we’ll take a closer look at who Emma Shafer was and what led to her untimely passing. Keep reading more.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading style=font-size:25px><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_was_Emma_Shafer></span><strong>Who was Emma Shafer?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Emma Shafer was a young woman who was loved by many in her community. While details of her background and life have not been widely shared, it is clear that those who knew her are deeply saddened by her loss. Emma was only 24 years old when she passed away in 12 July of 2023. Despite her youth, Emma had a profound impact on those around her. She was known for her kindness and her love of life, and she took pride in her Springfield neighborhood. Emma’s friends remember her as an awesome friend who loved to meditate, eat falafel, and clean tables at her favorite hangouts.</p><p><strong>Post below:</strong><br>Jenn Kay<br>Emma was such a beautiful person, caring so much for others and always lit up with a smile. I only knew her a short time, but in that time, she had nothing but positivity to share. Emma was one of my staff members when I was director of the shelter and a very active community advocate for Springfield. I’m at a loss for words about such a tragic death of such a pure soul. ♥️</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading style=font-size:25px><span class=ez-toc-section id=How_did_Emma_Shafer_die_What_was_the_Cause_of_Death></span><strong>How did Emma Shafer die? What was the Cause of Death?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The news of Emma Shafer’s untimely death has shaken the community of Springfield. Reports reveal that she suffered multiple stab wounds in her own home, allegedly at the hands of her boyfriend, Gabriel Calixto. Law enforcement officials were notified by a concerned sister in Bethalto, Illinois, and arrived on the scene to find Emma’s lifeless body. The circumstances surrounding her death are still under investigation, with homicide being suspected as the cause. Emma’s identity was kept concealed until her family could be contacted, and an autopsy could be conducted. As the Springfield Police Department continues to investigate this tragic event, they urge anyone with information to come forward. Despite the ongoing investigation, the community hopes to receive answers soon and hold the responsible party accountable for their actions.</p><p><strong>Marc A. Ayers</strong><br>Just doesn’t make sense. Unspeakable violence took the life of a friend, an animal advocate, environmental justice warrior, and community activist. Emma Shafer and I met for coffee a few months ago to discuss ways to lobby the county board more effectively on environmental issues. She attended county and city meetings and was a voice of hope and change for the better. Sometimes I don’t understand how such bad things can happen to such young good people. RIP Emma. 😭</p><p>As the investigation into Emma’s death continues, it’s important that we all do our part to support those who are hurting in the wake of this tragedy. Services such as counseling and therapy may be necessary for those who are struggling to come to terms with what has happened, and it’s important that we all keep an eye out for signs that someone we know may be struggling.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading style=font-size:25px><span class=ez-toc-section id=Emma_Shafer_Obituary></span><strong>Emma Shafer Obituary</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>The loss of Emma Shafer is a reminder that violence can strike at any moment, and that we all need to do our part to make our communities safer. Though we can’t bring Emma back, we can honor her memory by working towards a future where we all feel safe and supported. Our hearts go out to Emma’s loved ones during this difficult time, and we hope that they are able to find solace and support in the days and weeks to come. Rest in peace, Emma. You will be deeply missed.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Tributes_Pours_to_Emma_Shafer></span><strong>Tributes Pours to Emma Shafer</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p><strong>Zi’keya Elcock</strong><br>My dearest Emma Shafer, I honestly don’t believe that you are gone. I shouldn’t be writing this. You are the greatest person I’ve ever known. I am beyond grateful that I had the honor of having you as a friend. I will miss you and I love you forever ❤️</p><p><strong>Kaitlin Cap</strong><br>No words can fully express the light and love this girl brought into this world. I had the privilege of meeting Emma Shafer when we caravanned down to ASP our first summer on staff. Her kindness was palpable and she was full of eagerness and enthusiasm. Emma was caring, selfless, bubbly, passionate, generous, and so much more. Her strive for justice, equality, sustainability, and activism has always been inspiring and will continue to motive me and countless others who were lucky enough to cross paths with her. To know Emma is to love her.<br>Nothing can ease the shock and devastation of Emma’s passing. The world lost something bright. My heart breaks for her family and those closest to her. May her light continue to shine in all the people that knew her and the places she loved. Rest easy Emma🖤</p><p>In the aftermath of Emma’s passing, many have taken to social media to express their grief and share their memories of her. Though we may never fully understand what led to this tragedy, what we do know is that Emma was loved and will be deeply missed by those who knew her.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZminqJyusb%2BNqKmgZ5WiuqJ50qGYn52iYrGmrcNo</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2femma-shafer-dead.html&text=Emma%20Shafer%20dead%3a%20Suspect%20Under%20Investigation%20for%20Emmas%20Stabbing&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2femma-shafer-dead.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2femma-shafer-dead.html&title=Emma%20Shafer%20dead%3a%20Suspect%20Under%20Investigation%20for%20Emmas%20Stabbing" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2femma-shafer-dead.html&title=Emma%20Shafer%20dead%3a%20Suspect%20Under%20Investigation%20for%20Emmas%20Stabbing" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2femma-shafer-dead.html&title=Emma%20Shafer%20dead%3a%20Suspect%20Under%20Investigation%20for%20Emmas%20Stabbing" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2femma-shafer-dead.html&description=Emma%20Shafer%20dead%3a%20Suspect%20Under%20Investigation%20for%20Emmas%20Stabbing" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./harry-nilsson.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Harry Nilsson">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./emily-maynard-gives-birth-welcomes-baby-boy-with-husband-first-photo-2015167.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Emily Maynard Gives Birth, Welcomes Baby Boy With Husband: First Photo">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
