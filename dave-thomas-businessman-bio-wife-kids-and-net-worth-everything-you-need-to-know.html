In order to enlighten others not to follow the same path he did, he also started a foundation that offers GED courses for young adults and s is called Dave Thomas Education Center.</span></p><p><span>He served in the army for three years from 1950 to 1953.

After their marriage, they had five adorable children, four daughters – Melinda, Molly, Pam and Lori, as well as a son named Kenny Thomas.&nbsp;Sadly, her son Kenny kicked the bucket in 2013. The amazing couple were married for forty-seven years before Dave’s sudden disappearance in 2002.</span></p><p><span>Just like Dave, all of his children are equally successful in life.&nbsp;They are actively involved in their father’s business and currently own several Wendy’s restaurant locations in the United States.&nbsp;In honor of his daughters, Dave started&nbsp;</span><span>Sisters Chicken and Cookies</span><span>&nbsp;in 1978.
