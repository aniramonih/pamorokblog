But is there any truth to it?&nbsp;Let’s find out</strong></p><p>Stories, Myths, and Legends are some of the features that make Hollywood as great as it is. An addiction for those who’ve made it home and an eternal dream for those still vying for its favor.&nbsp;</p><p>In this article, we’ll be revisiting a rumor that, over the years, has become a myth that is talked about to this day. Celebrity rumors are unending; however, it’s always rare to see one that has lasted for decades.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Richard_Geres_%E2%80%98Gerbil_Rumor></span><strong>Richard Gere’s ‘Gerbil’ Rumor</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>At the center of this story is the famous actor Richard Gere who found himself the main subject of an incredulous rumor. During the early 90s, Gere had become quite popular due to several successful movies, including “Pretty Woman.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.pinimg.com/564x/a5/41/f0/a541f0e1c2c5168d8357f27587146c4a.jpg><p>Back then, the actor was romantically involved with model Cindy Crawford and was living his best life. However, around that time, Gere was surprisingly admitted to Cedars-Sinai Hospital in California for an emergency procedure.&nbsp;</p><p>According to the rumors that later <a href=#>floated </a>around, doctors were trying to remove an object that got stuck in the actor’s rectum. As some people told it, the object was a gerbil animal that was seemingly inserted with erotic intent.&nbsp;</p><p>Allegedly, the poor animal was placed inside a condom and subsequently inserted by a cardboard tube. Its death spasms would then provide the recipient jolts of prostate tickling. This act is tagged “gerbiling.”</p><p>Although the story sounded incredulous and far-fetched, Hollywood is not synonymous with normality, so it was easier for people to believe the story than discredit it.&nbsp;</p><p>For many years this particular rumor remained, and even to this day. However, was this allegation true? Let’s find out.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Is_Gerbiling_Real></span><strong>Is Gerbiling Real?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>To get to the bottom of this story, one must confirm if the sexual act of “gerbiling” is real. A quick Wikipedia search defined the act as a rumored sexual practice.&nbsp;Also, in 2013, sex-advice columnist Dan Savage <a href=#>noted </a>that he’d never heard of any form of the sexual act in real life. National Enquirer columnist Mike Walker also once declared he’d never heard of a story like that.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.pinimg.com/564x/00/a1/8e/00a18e0d1adfa470831ea849fedc6e62.jpg><p>Judging by how the gerbiling act has only ever been mentioned in connection to Gere, one wonders if there’s any truth to it. However, the only reasonable conclusion we can make is that this gerbiling act was always a rumor.&nbsp; It has probably never happened before, and it didn’t happen to Gere.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Gere_Addresses_The_Gerbil_Myth></span><strong>Gere Addresses The Gerbil Myth&nbsp;</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>During an interview with Metro, Gere explained that since the beginning of his career, he’s had to deal with many rumors. That actor noted that there were many crazy things about him appearing in the tabloids.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>However, Gere disclosed that he no longer reads the press since all they do is write strange things about him. The actor also touched on the gerbiling rumors <a href=#>saying</a>:&nbsp;</p><p><strong>“There is an infamous ‘Gere stuck a hamster up his bum’ urban myth. I expect that sort of thing but when reputable magazines started making up stories claiming I was in a country I had never been to with someone I didn’t even know, I just decided not to pay attention to any of it. It’s a waste of energy.”</strong></p><p>With all parties debunking this outrageous rumor, one wonders how it has lasted this long. Also, who came up with this rumor in the first place? Well, most of the fingers pointed in one direction, Sylvester Stallone.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Did_Sylvester_Stallone_Start_The_%E2%80%9CGerbil%E2%80%9D_Rumors></span><strong>Did Sylvester Stallone Start The “Gerbil” Rumors</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>It might not be a big feud to make rap songs about, but Gere and <a href=#>Stallone</a> do not get along. Of course, the two actors weren’t always like that; however, their beef started when they were both casts in “The Lord of Flatbush.”&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>The pair reportedly fit into an argument that led to Gere’s dismissal from the movie. Since then, the pair’s relationship has deteriorated, which is why some people believe Stallone is responsible for the rumor.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2006, Stallone spoke about his relationship with Gere, <a href=#>stating </a>he thinks the actor still harbors a grudge against him. However, he denied being the person who started the gerbil rumor.&nbsp;</p><p>There is no concrete evidence of how Richard Gere’s gerbil rumor started or why it did. However, it has followed the actor for years and will end as one of the unsolvable Hollywood myths.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmajBp7HSrWWcp51ktrR506Gcq51dlru6edOrrK2gXam8br7InJ%2BaqpRitKa%2BxGaenqqSnrluuM6nnmarpJa7pbXNoGSrrZ2kv3A%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fis-there-any-truth-to-richard-gere-gerbil-long-standing-rumor.html&text=Is%20There%20Any%20Truth%20To%20Richard%20Gere%27s%20%26quot%3bGerbil%26quot%3b%20Long-Standing%20Rumor%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fis-there-any-truth-to-richard-gere-gerbil-long-standing-rumor.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fis-there-any-truth-to-richard-gere-gerbil-long-standing-rumor.html&title=Is%20There%20Any%20Truth%20To%20Richard%20Gere%27s%20%26quot%3bGerbil%26quot%3b%20Long-Standing%20Rumor%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fis-there-any-truth-to-richard-gere-gerbil-long-standing-rumor.html&title=Is%20There%20Any%20Truth%20To%20Richard%20Gere%27s%20%26quot%3bGerbil%26quot%3b%20Long-Standing%20Rumor%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fis-there-any-truth-to-richard-gere-gerbil-long-standing-rumor.html&title=Is%20There%20Any%20Truth%20To%20Richard%20Gere%27s%20%26quot%3bGerbil%26quot%3b%20Long-Standing%20Rumor%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fis-there-any-truth-to-richard-gere-gerbil-long-standing-rumor.html&description=Is%20There%20Any%20Truth%20To%20Richard%20Gere%27s%20%26quot%3bGerbil%26quot%3b%20Long-Standing%20Rumor%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./jennifer-finnigan-net-worth-income-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Jennifer Finnigan Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./annika-boron.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Is Instagram model, Annika Boron currently dating anyone?
