As of July 2024, he has a net worth of about $1.5 billion, which is a decline from $3.1 Billion in 2012. The reason behind this drop is not known. Lampert has garnered most of his net worth from his career as a businessman. However, he has received criticism for being the reason behind the poor performance of Sears.</p><p>Lampert began his career journey well, and it seemed fulfilling. He even appeared on the top of the list of world’s billionaires. Moreover, the world also hailed him for his great success and expected him to be the next Warren Buffet.
