Her philanthropic works have led her to provide emergency aid due to disasters and poor economic situations.</span></p><p><span>She has also raised huge charity and owns a business to help fund more relief aid worldwide. Stay with us to find out more about her!</span></p><h2><span><strong>Lauren Akins Family, Height</strong></span></h2><p><span>Lauren Akins was born on 8 November 1989 in Tennessee, USA, as Lauren Gregory. She spent her childhood days with her parents in the suburban neighborhood of Madison, northeast Nashville. In the family, she has two siblings named Grayson and Macy.</span></p><p><span>For high school education, she attended Goodpasture Christian School. After completing high school, she got enrolled at the University of Tennessee. While she was in college, she was part of the Alpha Delta Pi sorority and got involved in several extracurricular activities. She graduated from college with a Bachelor of Science in Nursing.</span></p><p><span>The 31-year-old nurse stands at the height of 5 feet 10 inches and weighs around 54 kg.</span></p><h2><span><strong>Lauren Akins Relationship With Thomas Rhett</strong></span></h2><p><span>Lauren Akins is married to her childhood sweetheart Thomas Rhett since 12 October 2012. They attended the same church and dated for a while at the age of 15 but later separated. However, they met once again in 2011 and got engaged in December 2011.</span></p><p><span>Lauren and Thomas’s love story goes way back to when they were first graders. They attended the same church, became close friends. Eventually, they dated for a brief period, which did not work out. So they broke up and remained as friends.</span></p><p><span>It was in 2011 when their relationship took a turn over. Thomas was invited to attend Lauren’s sister’s graduation party when her father gave Thomas a little push he needed with a little bit of threat for their patch-up. With success, they again started to go out.</span></p><p><span>In December 2011, Thomas proposed Lauren in her favorite restaurant with the help of his mother. He went with a standard and lovely way by writing ‘Marry Me’ on a bottle of wine. Lauren answered by writing ‘Yes’ on the same bottle, which concluded their engagement.</span></p><p><span>A year later, they tied the knot on 12 October 2012, spending their honeymoon at Oahu. On 12 May 2017, they adopted a baby girl from Uganda, Willa Gray Akins (born 1 November 2015). They also have a biological daughter named Ada James Akins (born 12 August 2017). They welcomed their daughter Lennon Love Akins in 2020.</span></p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/glamourbiz.com/images/uploads/lauren-akins-thomas-rhett-and-their-kids.jpg alt="lauren akins thomas rhett and their kids" width=650 height=433 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p><span><strong>Lauren Akins with her husband Thomas Rhett and their three kids (©: tennessean.com)</strong></span></p><p><span>The duo’s romance is some real deal we should look for. They are so in love with each other, being childhood sweethearts and all. Lauren, back in 2019, explained on social media how caring her husband is. Lauren faced some issues with her health due to pregnancy, and that’s where Thomas stepped up to demonstrate his part of love for her and her family.</span></p><p><span>Lauren says her husband has “basically been Santa’s elf, cooking, doing baths & the girls’ bedtimes and still making time to take me on a date.” That’s some dreamy boy we got here.</span></p><h2><span><strong>Net Worth Of Lauren Akins</strong></span></h2><p><span>Lauren Akins is a working nurse who has continuously been aiding the needy by raising charity and funding them worldwide. As for her net worth, it has not been calculated. However, her husband, Thomas Rhett, an American country music singer, has <a href=# rel=noopener>accumulated a net worth</a> of $5 million.</span></p><p><span>After graduating with good academic results, Lauren began working for several charity-based organizations, providing all her nursing skills to the needy. Her work took her to third-world countries in need of aid like Haiti, Honduras, Kenya, and Uganda. They lengthened her stays on each of the places for helping people on the utmost. Uganda was the country where she met the little girl to adopt into her home with her husband.</span></p><p><span>Lauren Akins is currently with the charity organization 147 Million Orphans. In 2016, Lauren, along with her husband Thomas, raised more than $250k for the organization. Lauren is a philanthropist, and she runs a jewelry line with Emily Dee called the 'Lauren Akins X Ladybird' line. Besides this, she has also appeared in several of her husband’s music videos.</span></p><p><span>The couple was also offered to star on a reality show to open up more about their family. After giving it fair consideration, he politely declined to say that the two of them are already sharing enough of their family online. He also shared a post on social media writing that a reality show would be “too much.”</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifnJa6sMHRm6CzZpOkunCvxKWcm6qZqbamv46lmK6qlaN6orfIp6pmnpGitq3FjK2fqKWRqHqztMStq2amlal6uLvRrZ8%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2flauren-akins-family-thomas-rhett-net-worth.html&text=Lauren%20Akins%20Family%2c%20Height%20%7c%20Relationship%20With%20Thomas%20Rhett%2c%20%26amp%3b%20Net%20Worth%20Details&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2flauren-akins-family-thomas-rhett-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2flauren-akins-family-thomas-rhett-net-worth.html&title=Lauren%20Akins%20Family%2c%20Height%20%7c%20Relationship%20With%20Thomas%20Rhett%2c%20%26amp%3b%20Net%20Worth%20Details" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2flauren-akins-family-thomas-rhett-net-worth.html&title=Lauren%20Akins%20Family%2c%20Height%20%7c%20Relationship%20With%20Thomas%20Rhett%2c%20%26amp%3b%20Net%20Worth%20Details" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2flauren-akins-family-thomas-rhett-net-worth.html&title=Lauren%20Akins%20Family%2c%20Height%20%7c%20Relationship%20With%20Thomas%20Rhett%2c%20%26amp%3b%20Net%20Worth%20Details" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2flauren-akins-family-thomas-rhett-net-worth.html&description=Lauren%20Akins%20Family%2c%20Height%20%7c%20Relationship%20With%20Thomas%20Rhett%2c%20%26amp%3b%20Net%20Worth%20Details" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./man-from-manila-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Man from Manila">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./lance-bass-engaged-n-sync-member-proposes-to-boyfriend-michael-turchin-201319.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Lance Bass Engaged: 'N Sync Star Proposes to Boyfriend Michael Turchin">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
