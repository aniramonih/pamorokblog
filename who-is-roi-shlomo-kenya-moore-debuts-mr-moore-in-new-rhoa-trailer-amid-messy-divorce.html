Kenya is dating Roi Shlomo, an Israeli entrepreneur from Atlanta in his mid-40s.</p><p><a href=# rel>Season 15 of 'RHOA' </a>is shaping up to be the most exciting ever.&nbsp;<a href=# rel>Kandi Burruss</a>, the longest-serving housewife on the show, will return, along with some new and old characters, and you can be sure that the ladies will bring the drama. Kenya has it all figured out. The hair care magnate is expanding her business and opening her own hair salon. Kenya is still enjoying herself as she gets back into the dating scene, but one concern remains that her divorce is not finalized.</p><p><strong>RELATED ARTICLES</strong></p><p><a href=# rel>‘With all due disrespect, burn it’: 'RHOA’ star Kenya Moore brutally roasted over her new blonde wig</a></p><p><a href=# rel>'RHOA' Season 14: Kenya Moore slams Marlo Hampton for using 'fake name' during tense reunion fight</a></p><h2 class=split>Who is Roi Shlomo?</h2><p>Roi, who appears in the current season of 'RHOA,' is the founder of many enterprises, including Kale Me Crazy, Aziza Restaurant & Lounge in Turks & Caicos, and ATL's Kanvas Event Space, which opened last year. He previously founded and sold Yogli Mogli, a frozen yogurt brand, in 2014. Kale Me Crazy, a superfood cafe, opened in Atlanta in 2013 and has since spread to 24 additional locations, including one in West Hollywood, California. The revenue of the franchise is anticipated to be $13.4 million, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">The Sun </a>reports.&nbsp;</p><p>Roi is no stranger to the limelight. He's been interviewed and published in both local and national publications, including Simply Buckhead and Modern Luxury Jezebel.</p><p>According to Roi's internet bio, he is from Israel and enjoys traveling to nations outside the United States. He, like Kenya, believes in giving back and supporting local charities. "I was raised by my family to give back. Even when I was young, my parents and I would volunteer and donate food and time in Israel. It was and continues to be a source of joy," he told Best Self Atlanta.</p><p>When Roi's business declined, the superfood pioneer felt compelled to assist local overworked and stressed-out hospital workers. Roi, who established the first Kale Me Crazy location in 2013, took to social media to solicit ideas on how he might assist. Roi began distributing "immunity shots" of fresh juices to Grady, Emory Saint Joseph's, Emory Midtown, and Piedmont hospitals out of his own money. To take things a step further, he received backing from Sharcare and its CEO, Jeff Arnold. They launched a GoFundMe page, and Jeff matched the first $10,000 dollar for dollar towards healthy juice shots and meals, depending on the need. This enabled Kale Me Crazy to take a giant step ahead in getting its products to more hospitals, as well as police and firefighters.</p><p>Despite the fact that nothing is known about Roi's previous dating life, he did introduce a little baby girl on his Instagram last September. When someone questioned in the comments if it was his baby, it didn't take long for Roi to clear up everyone's uncertainty. Roi's baby has only appeared on Daddy's Instagram four times since then, but each time she made sure to take the spotlight from the profile owner. Roi has yet to announce the name of his daughter or, more importantly, the identity of his baby momma. Given his daughter's age, it's reasonable to infer Roi's relationship before Kenya was recent.</p><p>It will be interesting to see Kenya debuting a fresh flame to the world in the midst of her divorce from her ex Marc.</p><h2 class=split>Did Monyetta Shaw play cupid for Kenya Moore and Roi Shlomo?</h2><p>Another fascinating thing we learned from Roi's Instagram page was that he was no stranger to the 'RHOA' cast before meeting Kenya. One could even argue that someone in the cast played Cupid and set the two up. Roi is claimed to be close with Monyetta Shaw, a friend of the 'RHOA' cast members. Monyetta initially appeared on his profile in 2018. Since then, they've been spotted commenting on one other's posts, referring to each other as twins (they're both Geminis!), and Monyetta even referring to Roi's child as "her niece."</p><p>Last year, Monyetta made her debut appearance on the show, prior to that she revealed her opinions about Kenya as she joined Kandi for 'Speak On It.' She said, "I’ve been knowing Kenya, well knowing of Kenya through you. We met at a few parties and everything. She was always pleasant to me. And she is friends with our other mutual friend, Toby. So she was nothing but nice. People did tell me, ‘Watch out for her, y’all. She ain’t your friend. Watch out.’ And I think I may have gotten a little taste of that with the baby momma…”</p><p>Monyetta was supposedly offended when Kenya referred to her as Ne-yo's baby momma. However, she recognizes that it is not a derogatory term for everyone, "but maybe some people don't think it's a negative."</p><p>Regardless, Monyetta dislikes the phrase, "I mean, but still, you know what I’m saying? I was the fiancée so I feel it could have been shade."</p><p>"But she's been very friendly to me," she says, despite the fact that she didn't appreciate Kenya calling her a baby momma. "But she’s been very friendly to me. I don’t know about the clip, but I guess however you take it, I just don’t like that word. It’s all good. She’s been super cool."</p><p>Monyetta had more to say on Twitter after the video became viral. "Now..." she wrote. "No shade at the baby mamas but @KenyaMoore but didn’t you mean EX-FIANCE??"</p><p>Kenya responded by tweeting, "Yes! I said it but it was used! And what a lovely WIFE you are now."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/9e44461a-3631-4976-9132-c1eb2b9e003b.png><h2 class=split>'He popped my cherry'</h2><p>The entrepreneur was first introduced to Bravo viewers when the 'RHOA' Season 15 promo debuted last month. Kenya is shown in the clip stroking his arm and saying, "You look sexy."</p><p>Roi, dressed stylishly in a beige jacket, grins as he talks with the group, and the girls giggle at Kenya's evident infatuation. Kenya then tells the cameras, "We might be looking at another Mr Moore."</p><p>She is then shown sharing the cast of her FaceTime video with Roi when they are sitting at a restaurant. Marlo Hampton, Kenya's long-time adversary, confesses, "Is that Roi? I went on a date with him before. He popped my cherry."</p><p>Since the TV personality does not appear to believe Marlo's claim, she pretends to vomit and says, "Sorry, there's some bulls**t that got stuck in my throat."</p><p>While promoting the upcoming season, Kenya remained firm. "It's not true. It's 100 percent not true," regarding Marlo's claim, Kenya told <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">ET</a> that she "makes up everything. You can't believe a word that comes out of her mouth."</p><p>The reality star hinted at her new love interest in an interview with ET earlier this month. "Roi has been someone that I've known for a while, over a year, as friends and I just think we have a lot in common," she revealed. "We have friends in common, likes in common, and, if nothing else, a great friendship."</p><p>'The Real Housewives of Atlanta' premieres on May 7 at 8 PM ET on Bravo.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRor5ikeqq%2FjKumomWjnbmwuc5mop6mqZZ6rrvOq5xmnJWXwrW%2FjKapZqWfpL%2BmecinZKedp2K%2FqbvAZqurmZmhsrN5wKagnWWdmsC0xYydoK%2Bnopiy</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwho-is-roi-shlomo-kenya-moore-debuts-mr-moore-in-new-rhoa-trailer-amid-messy-divorce.html&text=Who%20is%20Kenya%20Moore%27s%20boyfriend%3f%20%27RHOA%27%20co-star%20Marlo%20Hampton%20claims%20he%20popped%20her%20cherry&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-is-roi-shlomo-kenya-moore-debuts-mr-moore-in-new-rhoa-trailer-amid-messy-divorce.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-roi-shlomo-kenya-moore-debuts-mr-moore-in-new-rhoa-trailer-amid-messy-divorce.html&title=Who%20is%20Kenya%20Moore%27s%20boyfriend%3f%20%27RHOA%27%20co-star%20Marlo%20Hampton%20claims%20he%20popped%20her%20cherry" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwho-is-roi-shlomo-kenya-moore-debuts-mr-moore-in-new-rhoa-trailer-amid-messy-divorce.html&title=Who%20is%20Kenya%20Moore%27s%20boyfriend%3f%20%27RHOA%27%20co-star%20Marlo%20Hampton%20claims%20he%20popped%20her%20cherry" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-roi-shlomo-kenya-moore-debuts-mr-moore-in-new-rhoa-trailer-amid-messy-divorce.html&title=Who%20is%20Kenya%20Moore%27s%20boyfriend%3f%20%27RHOA%27%20co-star%20Marlo%20Hampton%20claims%20he%20popped%20her%20cherry" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-is-roi-shlomo-kenya-moore-debuts-mr-moore-in-new-rhoa-trailer-amid-messy-divorce.html&description=Who%20is%20Kenya%20Moore%27s%20boyfriend%3f%20%27RHOA%27%20co-star%20Marlo%20Hampton%20claims%20he%20popped%20her%20cherry" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./mike-whan-wikipedia-married.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who Is Mike Whan?
