He’s most known for his work as Cadet Larvell Jones, a role he played in all seven “Police Academy” films, and as the radar technician in “Spaceballs.”He’s also lent his voice to “Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas” and has appeared in the SyFy films “Sharknado 3: Oh Hell No!,” “Lavalantula” and “2 Lava 2 Lantula.”</p><p>He also incorporates his talent into his standup comedy, which brings him to the 219 Lounge in Sandpoint on Friday and Saturday.Winslow told the Sandpoint Reader that audiences can expect to “forget about their rent for an hour” when watching his standup shows and that he doesn’t mention politics onstage.</p><p>“I’m a performing artist, and I’m not comfortable with alienating 50 percent of my audience,” he said. “Why would I want to offend the very people who need help, or a release (from comedy)?”</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_7"></span><p>Winslow’s talent also put him at the forefront of the beatboxing scene, and he’s often credited as an innovator of the artform. He does a lot of soundtrack work and also performs incredible renditions of tunes like “Whole Lotta Love” by Led Zeppelin and “Purple Haze” by Jimi Hendrix.</p><p>Winslow has recently worked on projects with Run the Jewels, Jon Anderson of Yes and Grammy award-winning bassist Victor Wooten and told the Reader he plans on releasing three EPs in the near future – one featuring hip-hop, R&B and beatboxing, another featuring EDM and the third featuring death metal.</p><p>“I’ve figured out how to make death metal music,” he said. “The lead singer always sounds like he’s throwing up in a bucket.”</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_7"></span><p>When asked to reflect on his career trajectory, Winslow can’t quite believe he managed to turn a childhood habit into a full-fledged career, but he’s grateful for the experiences it’s brought.“It’s been quite an adventure,” he said. “I feel very, very fortunate. I just don’t know what to think of it half the time. I’m very grateful I’ve had these opportunities.”</p><p><strong>Source:www.spokesman.com</strong></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_16"></span><h3>About InformationCradle Editorial Staff</h3><p>This Article is produced by <strong>InformationCradle Editorial Staff</strong> which is a team of expert<strong> writers</strong> and <strong>editors</strong> led by <a href=#><strong>Josphat Gachie</strong></a> and trusted by millions of readers worldwide.</p><p>We endeavor to keep our content <strong>True</strong>, <strong>Accurate</strong>, <strong>Correct</strong>, <strong>Original</strong> and <strong>Up to Date</strong>.
