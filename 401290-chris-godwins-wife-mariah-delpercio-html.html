The pair were high school sweethearts passionate about physical fitness and animal rescue. Besides individual pursuits, Godwin and DelPercio collaborated to launch a foundation to help rescue dogs.</p><p class=dh>Rod Christopher Godwin Jr., known as Chris Godwin in the sports industry, is a professional football player for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Three years after being chosen in the 2017 NFL draft, he experienced his first Super Bowl win in 2021.</p><p class=dh>Godwin's wife, Mariah DelPercio, is a witness to her husband's hard work and has been supportive of his career. DelPercio was his high school sweetheart who also chose an athletic career.</p><p><h2 class=hh><strong class=bh>They Didn't Fall In Love; They Built Their Love</strong></h2></p><p class=dh>DelPercio and Godwin <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.the-sun.com/sport/4849339/who-is-chris-godwin/>met</a> at 13 and fell in love when they were students at Middletown High School, Delaware. Back then, they would work out together, a passion they still share.</p><p class=dh>After high school, DelPercio took up sports nutrition and exercise science at Penn State University and pursued a career as a fitness instructor. While pursuing her pursuits, she stood by Godwin and nourished their relationship.</p><h3 class=ih><strong class=bh>The $60 million three-year deal made headlines, noting that the NFL player would have another season to share the field with Tom Brady. Still, the one who was most happy for Godwin was his wife.</strong></h3><p class=dh>According to the athlete, their relationship has always been about supporting each other and pushing each other to be the best version of themselves. He <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/CR7GCnHswJM/>said</a>:</p><p class=dh>"We always say we didn't just fall in love and fall into a magical relationship – we BUILT the love and relationship that we have, and we continue to build it every day."</p><p class=dh>In March 2018, while on vacation in Cape Town, South Africa, Godwin asked DelPercio to marry him. As she narrated in an Instagram post, her then-boyfriend took her to see a fantastic view of the mountains just before they dined.</p><p class=dh>While she marveled at the scenic beauty of nature, he got down on one knee and proposed. "Everything after that felt like time was standing still; it was surreal," she <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/B92abDclt6x/>said</a>. DelPercio married him in May 2021.</p><p><h2 class=hh><strong class=bh>Chris Godwin's Wife Supports His Career Wholeheartedly</strong></h2></p><p class=dh>DelPercio is proud of her husband's success in his <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.nfl.com/players/chris-godwin/>career</a> and does not shy from posting about his achievements on social media. Godwin, who began his career selected 84th overall by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in 2017, signed a new contract with the team in 2022.</p><p class=dh>The $60 million three-year deal made headlines, noting that the NFL player would have another season to share the field with Tom Brady. Still, the one who was most happy for Godwin was his wife.</p><p class=dh>On her Instagram, she shared that her husband once said he didn't care much about where he was placed on draft day; what mattered was the chance he would get. She recalled him <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://nypost.com/2022/03/17/chris-godwins-wife-posts-emotional-note-after-buccaneers-deal/>adding</a>:</p><p class=dh>"I'm [going to] take full advantage of the opportunity I get, and I only need one chance. I'm [going to] win a Super Bowl & I'm [going to] make it to a second contract in the league. I only need a chance."</p><p class=dh>Godwin's mindset, talent, and perseverance allowed him to accomplish his goals within a few years, and DelPercio was honored to have been a part of his journey. Despite his success, DelPercio praised her husband for remaining kind and humble as he had been since they met.</p><p><h2 class=hh><strong class=bh>Chris Godwin and Mariah DelPercio Had Some Super Bowl Fun with Confetti</strong></h2></p><p class=dh>Godwin and DelPercio undoubtedly celebrate each other's wins. During the <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=417066932707487 ">Super Bowl 2021</a>, the couple was captured celebrating the Tampa Bay Buccaneers' win in the middle of the football field.</p><h3 class=ih><strong class=bh>Their foundation also supports injured and sick dogs who need resources to receive medical treatment and animals affected by natural calamities.</strong></h3><p class=dh>After the game, DelPercio ran into her then-fiancé's arms and hugged him for a while. The pair then enjoyed the red, black, and white confetti that covered the ground and laid down on the grass to take it all in.</p><p><h2 class=hh><strong class=bh>The Couple Co-founded an Organization to Help Dogs</strong></h2></p><p class=dh>Besides their respective pursuits, the couple collaborates in their shared organization, Team Godwin Foundation, where they rescue dogs.</p><p class=dh>DelPercio first fell in love with animal rescue when she volunteered at the Humane Society of Tampa Bay in 2018. She familiarized herself with animal rescue and the community and became an advocate for dogs.</p><p class=dh>Soon after, she influenced her husband to open his heart to dogs until they founded their non-profit organization. Besides animal rescue, the couple works toward disseminating information about proper dog care, such as the importance of neutering and spaying.</p><p class=dh>Particularly, DelPercio wants to end breed discrimination and educate others about what happens behind animal shelters and why the Adopt Don't Shop movement is essential.</p><p class=dh>Their foundation also supports injured and sick dogs who need resources to receive medical treatment and animals affected by natural calamities. Team Godwin Foundation maintains a <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.teamgodwin.org/diaster-relief>website</a> where the couple shares their work.</p><p class=dh>DelPercio and Godwin are fur parents to two dogs, Ziggy, the American Staffordshire Terrier, and Ghost, the Pomsky.</p><p class=dh>Like DelPercio, many NFL athletes married supportive women, including Eli Manning. The former football star married <a class="me a" href=#>Abby McGrew,</a> a fashion designer who would brave the cold to watch her husband's games from the sidelines.</p><p class=dh>Manning believed his wife was the lucky charm to winning his games, and he would lose when she sat elsewhere, like in the VIP suite. As a supportive wife, McGrew would stay by the bleachers to watch her husband's games regardless of the weather. Similarly, he supports her pursuits as well.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAb63MqKSapZFjsLC5jm1namppZXqktNGiqmafn5nEqrrSZq6inpViuqK%2ByJqfZpyVob2mvsKipmegpKK5</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2f401290-chris-godwins-wife-mariah-delpercio-html.html&text=Chris%20Godwin%27s%20Wife%20Mariah%20DelPercio%20Supports%20Him%20in%20His%20Sports%20Career&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f401290-chris-godwins-wife-mariah-delpercio-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2f401290-chris-godwins-wife-mariah-delpercio-html.html&title=Chris%20Godwin%27s%20Wife%20Mariah%20DelPercio%20Supports%20Him%20in%20His%20Sports%20Career" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2f401290-chris-godwins-wife-mariah-delpercio-html.html&title=Chris%20Godwin%27s%20Wife%20Mariah%20DelPercio%20Supports%20Him%20in%20His%20Sports%20Career" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2f401290-chris-godwins-wife-mariah-delpercio-html.html&title=Chris%20Godwin%27s%20Wife%20Mariah%20DelPercio%20Supports%20Him%20in%20His%20Sports%20Career" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f401290-chris-godwins-wife-mariah-delpercio-html.html&description=Chris%20Godwin%27s%20Wife%20Mariah%20DelPercio%20Supports%20Him%20in%20His%20Sports%20Career" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./clyde-randall-boone-net-worth-income-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Clyde Randall Boone Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./chris-ballard.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Chris Ballard">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
