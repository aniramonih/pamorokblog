He is the author of over 20 books and has lectured in over 25 countries. His passion is in sports, and although he is not actively involved in the field as a player, he does a great job as a reporter.</p><p>Maybe you know about David Icke very well, but do you know how old and tall is he and what is his net worth in 2024? If you do not know, we have prepared this article about details of David Icke’s short biography-wiki, career, professional life, personal life, today’s net worth, age, height, weight, and more facts. Well, if you’re ready, let’s start.</p><h2>Early Life & Biography</h2><p>David Icke was born on 29th&nbsp;April, in the year 1952 in Leicester General Hospital. His parents are Beric Vaughan Icke and Barbara J. Icke, who entered into the marriage in Leicester in 1951.</p><p>The family stayed in a terraced building on Lead Street. When David Icke was at the age of three years old, around 1955, they went to the Good wood estate, one of the city’s estates the post-war Labour administration built. He remembers having to hide beneath a window or chair when the council authorities came for the rent; after knocking, the authorities would walk all over the house, peering through windows.</p><p>His mother didn’t explain that it was about the house payment; she just told Icke to hide. &nbsp;David Icke wrote in the year 2003 that he still finds a fright when anyone knocks on the door. Icke pursued his education at the Whitehall Infant School, proceeding to Whitehall Junior School later.</p><h2>Personal Life</h2><p>David Icke met his first love of life, Linda Atherton, in May in the year 1971 at a dance at the Chesford Grange restaurant near Leamington Spa. Not so long after they met, Icke left home due to one of a number of the many arguments he had begun having with his father. His father was upset that Icke’s knee illness was interfering with his football profession.</p><p>David moved into a single room and worked in a travel company, travelling to Hereford two times in a seven day period in the evenings to play football. Icke, together with Atherton were married on 30 September in the year 1971, four months after they came together. Their daughter was given birth to in March in the year 1975, followed by one son in December in the year1981, and another child in November in the year 1992. The duo divorced in the year 2001 but remained good foes, and Atherton continued to work as Icke’s business manager.</p><p>In the year 1997, Icke met his second love of life, Pamela Leigh Richards, in Jamaica. He and Linda Atherton separated in the year 2001, and he and Richards entered into marriage the same year. &nbsp;The two separated in 2008 and divorced three years later. Icke contested for parliament in the year 2008 by-election for Haltemprice and Howden (an East Yorkshire constituency), on the issue of “Big Brother – The Big Picture.”</p><p>David Icke came 12th out of the total 26 candidates, with 110 votes (0.46%), making into a lost deposit. In November, in the year 2013, Icke launched an internet television station, The People’s Voice, broadcast from London.</p><h2>Age, Height, and Weight</h2><p>Being born on 29th April 1952, David Icke is 72 years old as of today’s date [current date]. His height is 1.73m tall, and his weight is 75 kg.</p><h2>Career</h2><p>In the year 1963, David Icke was given a chance for the Leicester Under-Fourteen team for the Boys. He left school at the age of 15 after being talent-spotted by Coventry City, who later signed him up in 1967 as their youth team’s goalkeeper. He also played for Oxford United’s second team and Northampton Town, on loan from Coventry. He was being paid up to £33 a week. &nbsp;But in the year 1973, at the age of 21, arthritis became so severe that he was forced to retire.</p><h2>Awards & Achievements</h2><p>Although David Icke might not have received any official award yet, we cannot ignore the fact that he has really brought great influence as a reporter. He does his work with passion, and many people have benefitted a lot from his commitment to his career.</p><h2>Net Worth & Salary of David Icke in [current date format=’Y’]</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.wealthypersons.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/David-Icke-Net-Worth.jpg><p>As of July 2024, David Icke net worth is $2 million. His net worth and income mainly come from his professional careers of a Conspiracy theorist, former sports broadcaster and football player. While he was playing football for his clubs as a goalkeeper, he was earning up to £33 a week.</p><p>David Icke’s philosophy and view of life is that we are all points of attention within the same state of Infinite Awareness, and the labels we are given and give ourselves are merely temporary experiences and not who we are. Thus to him, all racism is ridiculous and completely missing the point of who we are and where we are.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uLHApauhsaCav7S7zaxlnKedZLGiwsidZKKbm5p6r7HTZq6oqqSdenN8kWlka2hiZnw%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fdavid-icke-net-worth-2020-2021.html&text=David%20Icke%20Net%20Worth%202024%3a%20Age%2c%20Height%2c%20Weight%2c%20Wife%2c%20Kids%2c%20Bio-Wiki&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdavid-icke-net-worth-2020-2021.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdavid-icke-net-worth-2020-2021.html&title=David%20Icke%20Net%20Worth%202024%3a%20Age%2c%20Height%2c%20Weight%2c%20Wife%2c%20Kids%2c%20Bio-Wiki" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fdavid-icke-net-worth-2020-2021.html&title=David%20Icke%20Net%20Worth%202024%3a%20Age%2c%20Height%2c%20Weight%2c%20Wife%2c%20Kids%2c%20Bio-Wiki" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fdavid-icke-net-worth-2020-2021.html&title=David%20Icke%20Net%20Worth%202024%3a%20Age%2c%20Height%2c%20Weight%2c%20Wife%2c%20Kids%2c%20Bio-Wiki" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdavid-icke-net-worth-2020-2021.html&description=David%20Icke%20Net%20Worth%202024%3a%20Age%2c%20Height%2c%20Weight%2c%20Wife%2c%20Kids%2c%20Bio-Wiki" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./savannah-brinson.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Entrepreneur and Furniture Designer Savannah Brinson Married NBA Player, Savannah Brinson.
