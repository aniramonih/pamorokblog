Her health has been under scrutiny considering the fact that she has this frail look currently.</p><p>Many have wondered if she is a cancer patient, and in this article, we will be taking a look at if it is true that she has cancer or not.</p><h4 class=wp-block-heading>About Jada Pinkett Smith</h4><p>Jada Pinkett Smith is undoubtedly one of the best talk show hosts and actresses from the United States of America. She is a Daytime Emmy Award-winning co-host of the Facebook Watch talk show Red Table Talk. In 2021, Time named her one of the 100 most influential people in the world.</p><p>Jada was named after her mother’s favorite soap opera actress, Jada Rowland, and was born in Baltimore, Maryland.</p><p>Her mother’s family is Jamaican and Bajan, and her father’s family is African-American. Adrienne Banfield-Norris, the head nurse of a Baltimore inner-city clinic, and Robsol Pinkett Jr., a construction company owner, are her parents. Banfield-Norris became pregnant in high school, married, and divorced after a few months.</p><p>Pinkett was raised by her mother and grandmother, Jamaican-born social worker Marion Martin Banfield.</p><p>Banfield recognized her granddaughter’s interest in the arts and enrolled her in piano, tap dance, and ballet lessons.</p><p>She dated former basketball player Grant Hill while he was attending Duke University in the early 1990s.</p><p>Pinkett Smith had a close friendship with rapper Tupac Shakur while both were students at the Baltimore School for the Arts. She appeared in his music videos “Temptations” and “Keep Ya Head Up.”</p><p>She also created the concept for his “California Love” (1995) music video and had planned to direct it, but she dropped out.</p><p>She contributed $100,000 to Shakur’s bail in 1995, while he awaited an appeal on his sexual abuse conviction.</p><p>In the 2003 documentary Tupac: Resurrection, she stated that he was “one of my closest companions He was like a brother to me. For us, it went beyond friendship. You only get that kind of relationship once in a lifetime.”</p><p>She met Will Smith in 1994 while auditioning for the role of his character’s girlfriend, Lisa Wilkes, on the set of Smith’s television show The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air. She was deemed too short for the role, which went to actress Nia Long.</p><p>Will and Jada began dating after he divorced Sheree Fletcher. Will had previously developed feelings for Jada but had not pursued them. Jada eventually relocated from Baltimore to California to be with him.</p><p>Jaden Christopher Syre Smith, born in 1998, and Willow Camille Reign Smith, born in 2000, are their two children. She is also Trey Smith’s stepmother, her husband’s son from a previous marriage.</p><h4 class=wp-block-heading>Jada Pinkett Smith health: Is Will Smith’s wife having cancer?</h4><p>One notable thing about Jada Pinkett Smith currently is her health. At the moment, she looks quite sick and this has raised suspicions from her fans.</p><p>The truth about her health is that she&nbsp;revealed in 2018 that she had been diagnosed with the autoimmune disease alopecia areata.</p><p>Despite numerous medical tests, she claims she has not been able to pinpoint the cause of her alopecia, and she suspects it is due to stress.</p><p>In December 2021, she posted a video on her Instagram account of herself with a shaved head, writing: “I can only laugh at this point. Mama’s going to have to take it all the way down to the scalp so no one thinks she had brain surgery or something. I’m going to be friends with this alopecia… for life! “.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLTGqKqsoaBjsLC5jqOYnZldpbavt8Stq2arnZ7BqXnHnpilrJhitrR51qKjpWWjora1tNJmrqKelWKubq%2FAp5qeql2lrrW1xKeraA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fjada-pinkett-smith-health-is-will-smiths-wife-a-cancer-patient.html&text=Jada%20Pinkett%20Smith%20Health%2c%20Is%20Will%20Smiths%20Wife%20A%20Cancer%20Patient%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjada-pinkett-smith-health-is-will-smiths-wife-a-cancer-patient.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjada-pinkett-smith-health-is-will-smiths-wife-a-cancer-patient.html&title=Jada%20Pinkett%20Smith%20Health%2c%20Is%20Will%20Smiths%20Wife%20A%20Cancer%20Patient%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fjada-pinkett-smith-health-is-will-smiths-wife-a-cancer-patient.html&title=Jada%20Pinkett%20Smith%20Health%2c%20Is%20Will%20Smiths%20Wife%20A%20Cancer%20Patient%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fjada-pinkett-smith-health-is-will-smiths-wife-a-cancer-patient.html&title=Jada%20Pinkett%20Smith%20Health%2c%20Is%20Will%20Smiths%20Wife%20A%20Cancer%20Patient%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjada-pinkett-smith-health-is-will-smiths-wife-a-cancer-patient.html&description=Jada%20Pinkett%20Smith%20Health%2c%20Is%20Will%20Smiths%20Wife%20A%20Cancer%20Patient%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./jake-wallin-obituary.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Jake Wallin (Obituary): Death Cause, Funeral And More">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./is-bernie-kosar-sick-health-and-illness-update-2023.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Is Bernie Kosar Sick?
