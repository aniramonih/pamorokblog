Naderi obtained his bachelor’s degree in electrical engineering from the University of Tehran in Iran and later moved to the United States for further studies.<br>Naderi began his career at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in 1979, where he held various positions over the years. One of his notable roles was serving as the Associate Director of the JPL’s Project Formulation and Strategy, where he was responsible for planning and implementing several space missions.</p><p>During his tenure at NASA, Firouz Naderi played a crucial role in the exploration of Mars. He served as the Mars Program Manager and later as the Director of Solar System Exploration at JPL. He was involved in the planning and execution of numerous Mars missions, including the Mars Pathfinder, Mars Odyssey, Mars Exploration Rovers (Spirit and Opportunity), and the Mars Science Laboratory (Curiosity) missions.<br>Naderi’s contributions to space exploration earned him several prestigious awards and recognition. He received NASA’s Outstanding Leadership Medal and the NASA Distinguished Service Medal, among other accolades. After retiring from NASA in 2016, he continued to share his expertise as a consultant, speaker, and author, contributing to the promotion and advancement of space exploration and technology.<br>Recently he was paralyzed from the neck down after an accident. He wrote on his Facebook account:</p><p>“Life is unpredictable.I had a sudden low heart beat that made me pass out and strike my head against the wall causing one of my vertebra in my neck to protrude into the nerve canal causing total paralysis below my neck. Surgery was done on neck on Monday. A difficult and long rehab of 4 to 5 months is ahead of me which is only possible with support from friends and the love of my family. I will be off the Net for a few months. Will be back to you when I get better. Occasional post will be through my family”.</p><p>With deep sadness, however, Dr. Firouz Naderi passed away on Fri 9th June.
