Harry seconded his future wife's opinion, adding that <a class=hm-link href=#>Doria is "amazing"</a>. The proud mum, <a class=hm-link href=#>who lives in LA</a>, has largely kept out of the spotlight, quietly working as a yoga instructor and psychotherapist. Doria graduated from the University of Southern California with a master's degree in social work.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/89cf0452077b-gettyimages-960049638.jpg><p id=eLRS83gHRteH data-wc=97>Meghan has previously said of her mum: "My mum's a yoga instructor, but she does social work, as well, and she works specifically with the geriatric community. For me to watch this level of life-long sensitivity to nurturing and caregiving, but at the same time my mum has always been a free spirit. She's got dreadlocks and a nose ring. She just ran the LA Marathon. We can just have so much fun together, and yet, I'll still find so much solace in her support. That duality coexists the same way it would in a best friend."</p><strong class=fr-embedded><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/b79d275e1392-gettyimages-1036437588.jpg></strong><p id=eFv0zEmDDt7 data-wc=67>Author Halima Sadat explored Doria's ancestry in . She wrote: "Like many African Americans, Doria can trace her lineage back to the days of slave labour in the Deep South states of Georgia and Tennessee, in particular the area around Chattanooga." Meghan's great-grandmother, Netty Allen, lived in a humble wooden shack and grew up during a time of racial segregation and discrimination.&nbsp;</p><p id=eiuuwnkelV8 data-wc=76>The Allens eventually migrated north to Ohio, and it was there that Doria was born, before she moved to California in the sixties. Doria has travelled to the UK several times since Meghan tied the knot with Harry, and was most recently in the country to welcome her baby grandson, Archie Harrison. She is also in a beautiful photo with the Queen and Prince Phillip as they met their baby great grandson for the first time.</p><h2>Who is Meghan’s dad Thomas Markle Sr.?</h2><p id=ebtD64MGuEJ3 data-wc=64>Thomas, of Dutch and Irish descent, previously worked as an Emmy Award-winning lighting director. The family lived comfortably in the leafy suburb of Woodland Hills, an area popular with the stars, until Thomas and Doria divorced. Thomas currently resides in Mexico. Thomas, who shies away from the limelight, was expected to walk Meghan up the aisle but had to cancel after undergoing heart surgery.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/116227d85669-meghan-markle-dad-thomas-markle-instagram-fathers-day-z.jpg><p id=eaD7-vMLapag data-wc=40>Meghan released a statement at the time which read: "Sadly, my father will not be attending our wedding.
