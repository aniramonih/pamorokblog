He is currently in the hospital, fighting for his life in critical condition.</p><p>"This is a horrible, horrible event.

At this point, it remains uncertain, as per the authorities, whether Schmidt was specifically targeted or if the shooting was a random act of violence, the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">New York Post</a> reported.</p><p>"51st Avenue and Peoria is a very busy intersection, so we know for a fact that there were people within the area. There were vehicles driving within the area, so we believe there is somebody within the Valley that does know something about what happened," explained Winn, a public information officer for Glendale police.</p><p>"We believe there is someone in the Valley who knows what happened. If you saw an individual or vehicle, you’re asked to call the Glendale Police Department," he added.</p><p>Paul Sanchez, who is employed in the vicinity of where the shooting took place, informed AZ Family that individuals passing by Schmidt during his sermon would often hurl insults and obscenities at him.</p><p>Sanchez, who works nearby, recalled the harsh reality of the situation, "There was a lot of everything, really—hateful comments, people yelling at him, ‘Get off the street,’ all sorts of mean things." He expressed his disbelief at how the situation escalated to such an extent.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=split>Has the Glendale police made any arrests in this case?</h2><p>As of now, no arrests have been made related to the shooting. However, a statement from the Glendale Police Department indicates that detectives working on the case believe there are additional witnesses who may have crucial information about the incident.</p><p>The police are urging anyone with information about the shooting to contact them at 623-930-3000 or Silent Witness at 480-WITNESS. Spanish speakers can reach out to 480-TESTIGO.</p><h2 class=split>Hans Schmidt's family devastated over attack</h2><p>Schmidt's wife Zulya took to Instagram to share a distressing post. She pleaded with anyone who had information about the incident to step forward, as she prayed fervently for her husband’s swift recovery.</p><p>"My husband was shot in the head yesterday while street preaching on the corner of 51st Ave and Peoria If anyone has any info please contact 911," she captioned the post along with a picture of them together.&nbsp;</p><p>"Thank you for your prayers. Believing God has the final say. I love you so much babe," she wrote</p><p>Schmidt’s father Eric shared a post about the incident that occurred on the evening of November 15.</p><p>"This is my son, Hans. On the night of Wednesday, Nov 15th 2023, he was shot in the head while attending a church outreach on the street at the intersection of 51st Ave and Peoria in Glendale, AZ," Eric penned.</p><p>"Single entry point on the side on the left temple. The bullet traveled through his brain and is still inside on the right side of his head. No one heard the shot or saw where it came from," he added.</p><p>The heartbroken added, "No one had realized what happened at first. He had started seizures and vomiting and they took him to the hospital." At the time of this post, he is sedated and stable on life support. They are draining fluid from his head to relieve pressure on his brain."</p><p>He further noted, "So far they are saying it's inoperable. It's an incredibly sad situation. We are hoping for a miracle. If you have any information about the shooting, please contact the police."</p><p><span><b>More from <i>MEAWW</i></b></span></p><p><a href=#>Arizona energy utilities step up with $134,000 grants for communities hit by coal-fired plant closures</a></p><p><a href=#>Artificial turf popular in drought-stricken Arizona but environmentalists warn of hidden dangers</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRooJGjwG6%2FwqGkopykYq6ztdmopZplopq5qrPIqKysZZyarqWx0WZpb2WWnrSpwMinnmaen6d6rbXFnmSanqSav26uxKKloGWjnby1ecinZK2glWK1pq3DZq6hoZyaerG%2BxJqaoaGenA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fhans-schmidt-arizona-religious-leader-26-fighting-for-life-after-being-shot-in-the-head-while-preaching.html&text=Hans%20Schmidt%3a%20Arizona%20religious%20leader%2c%2026%2c%20fighting%20for%20life%20after%20being%20shot%20in%20the%20head%20while%20pre&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fhans-schmidt-arizona-religious-leader-26-fighting-for-life-after-being-shot-in-the-head-while-preaching.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fhans-schmidt-arizona-religious-leader-26-fighting-for-life-after-being-shot-in-the-head-while-preaching.html&title=Hans%20Schmidt%3a%20Arizona%20religious%20leader%2c%2026%2c%20fighting%20for%20life%20after%20being%20shot%20in%20the%20head%20while%20pre" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fhans-schmidt-arizona-religious-leader-26-fighting-for-life-after-being-shot-in-the-head-while-preaching.html&title=Hans%20Schmidt%3a%20Arizona%20religious%20leader%2c%2026%2c%20fighting%20for%20life%20after%20being%20shot%20in%20the%20head%20while%20pre" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fhans-schmidt-arizona-religious-leader-26-fighting-for-life-after-being-shot-in-the-head-while-preaching.html&title=Hans%20Schmidt%3a%20Arizona%20religious%20leader%2c%2026%2c%20fighting%20for%20life%20after%20being%20shot%20in%20the%20head%20while%20pre" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fhans-schmidt-arizona-religious-leader-26-fighting-for-life-after-being-shot-in-the-head-while-preaching.html&description=Hans%20Schmidt%3a%20Arizona%20religious%20leader%2c%2026%2c%20fighting%20for%20life%20after%20being%20shot%20in%20the%20head%20while%20pre" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./new-film-recommendations-disney-plus-hamilton.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="History with Hamilton: James King's Week in Films">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./lyrics-grown-man-charmeka-joquelle.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Grown man charmeka joquelle lyrics">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
