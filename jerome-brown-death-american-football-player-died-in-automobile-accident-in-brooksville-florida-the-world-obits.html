Brown was a professional football player from the United States. He was a member of the Eagles for his whole five-year National Football League career, which spanned from 1987 to 1991, before he passed away soon before the 1992 season. Both in 1990 and 1991, he was chosen to participate in the Pro Bowl. His collegiate football team was the Miami Hurricanes, and he played for them. Brown received his diploma from Hernando High School, which is located in Brooksville, Florida.</p><p>During the off season, he was frequently observed running laps around the track at the school. The calm temperament he displayed when assisting in the dispersal of a group of Ku Klux Klan protesters in Brooksville, Florida, in June of 1988 earned him credit for his actions. Brown was a standout player for the University of Miami football team, which is considered to be one of the most successful and possibly the most dominant programs in college football. Brown played collegiate football at the University of Miami.</p><p>Brown led a walkout by the Miami players five days before the 1987 Fiesta Bowl, during a promotional luncheon for the Fiesta Bowl together with the Penn State team. This was one of the more memorable experiences that Brown experienced during his time as a player for Miami. As the leader of the walkout, he posed the following question: “Did the Japanese go and sit down and have dinner with Pearl Harbor before they bombed them?” Brown and his teammates were of the opinion that the players from Penn State had shown them contempt by publicly making fun of Miami’s head coach, Jimmy Johnson, during a banquet that took place before the game. The Hurricanes were a heavy favorite, but Penn State defeated them by a score of 14-10 and was crowned the National Champions.</p><p>When Brown and another athlete from the University of Miami, Dan Sileo, were seen disembarking from a chartered University of Miami plane at Phoenix’s Sky Harbor International Airport while wearing Battle Dress Uniforms, they sparked an even greater scandal on a national level. In the year 1987, he received his degree from the University of Miami. Brown was selected by the Philadelphia Eagles in the first round of the 1987 National Football League Draft, which was the ninth overall pick.2 [2] Two times, in 1990 and 1991, he was chosen to participate in the Pro Bowl during his professional career with the Eagles, which lasted for a total of five years.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiao5x7prDUZ62nZ5qav7C5xGaZq6eno3qlscCtn2aZnZq%2Fqq%2FAp2Sfp5%2Bpr6K4y2anpZmpmr9usMiem2ahnmKutsDOpqaboZyaeqKvwqKbnqakYravecGrpqijo6u2rbjEZp2lp6KesaJ506GcZq%2Bfp7mlec6boK2rXw%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fjerome-brown-death-american-football-player-died-in-automobile-accident-in-brooksville-florida-the-world-obits.html&text=Jerome%20Brown%20Death%2c%20American%20Football%20Player%20Died%20In%20Automobile%20Accident%20In%20Brooksville%2c%20Florida%20&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjerome-brown-death-american-football-player-died-in-automobile-accident-in-brooksville-florida-the-world-obits.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjerome-brown-death-american-football-player-died-in-automobile-accident-in-brooksville-florida-the-world-obits.html&title=Jerome%20Brown%20Death%2c%20American%20Football%20Player%20Died%20In%20Automobile%20Accident%20In%20Brooksville%2c%20Florida%20" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fjerome-brown-death-american-football-player-died-in-automobile-accident-in-brooksville-florida-the-world-obits.html&title=Jerome%20Brown%20Death%2c%20American%20Football%20Player%20Died%20In%20Automobile%20Accident%20In%20Brooksville%2c%20Florida%20" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fjerome-brown-death-american-football-player-died-in-automobile-accident-in-brooksville-florida-the-world-obits.html&title=Jerome%20Brown%20Death%2c%20American%20Football%20Player%20Died%20In%20Automobile%20Accident%20In%20Brooksville%2c%20Florida%20" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjerome-brown-death-american-football-player-died-in-automobile-accident-in-brooksville-florida-the-world-obits.html&description=Jerome%20Brown%20Death%2c%20American%20Football%20Player%20Died%20In%20Automobile%20Accident%20In%20Brooksville%2c%20Florida%20" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./jesse-sullivan.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Jesse Sullivan Age | Wiki, Net worth, Bio, Height, Wife">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./jennifer-lopez-adele.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Jennifer Lopez Singing Along to Adele Is Exactly as Awesome as You'd Expect">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
