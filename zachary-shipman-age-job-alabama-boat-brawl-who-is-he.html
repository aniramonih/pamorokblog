What is his job? How old is he? Who are his parents?</p><p>The answers unfold as this article proceeds.</p><h3><strong>Meet Zachary Shipman, One Of The 3 Men Charged In The Alabama Boat Brawl</strong></h3><p>One of Alabama Boat Brawl attackers has been identified and his name is Zachary Chase Shipman, proprietor of Vasser’s Mini Mart. He was not only a participant in the altercation, but also among the first to flee the scene when he noticed that the police were present, according to internet users. Since his claimed identification, Twitter users have begun using the name, Chase Shipman.</p><p>Nevertheless, social media users have identified the people who started the fight from photographs and videos uploaded online instead of waiting for the names of the suspects to be officially confirmed. Steve Todd, Rachel Faulkner Todd, Catherine Cromer Martin, Anna Blake Langford, Mary Elizabeth Todd, Allen Todd, and Chase Shipman are some of the names mentioned.</p><p>Some people recognized the last name on the list, Chase Shipman, and discovered that he was a businessman with ties to Selma. The Selma Times Journal has also verified his identification and identified him as one of the fight’s participants. He spent the weekend canoeing with his family from Selma to Montgomery, according to reports from the journal.</p><p>What’s interesting is that Chase Shipman himself took to social media and posted: “I am sure most of you have seen the news about the riverboat incident. Yes, I was there but I was the first to try to get away.”</p><p>Chase continued by saying that he was aware of what had occurred and that, rather than getting into a fight, he had been trying to break up the conflict. When he was unable to, he attempted to flee. He also provided an explanation for why there are videos showing him leaving the scene first. He understood what was happening was wrong and “did not want to be a part of it.”</p><p>“I realize I have a business to run and represent, and no charges were filed against me because I was not involved.”</p><p>Unfortunately for him, because of his inconsistent comments and behavior in the video, viewers of the internet do not think he was telling the truth. They exposed him as a liar as a result, and his nasty evaluations of Vasser’s Mini Mart have also been trending. In fact, prior to the incident, the Facebook page had ratings above 4, which have since dropped to 1.9.</p><p>On August 6, 2023, a warrant was issued for his arrest. Zachary was 25 years old when he was arrested on August 8, 2023. He was charged with one count of third-degree assault.</p><h3><strong>Zachary Shipman Age</strong></h3><p>Per several reports, as of Aug 2023, Zachary Shipman is 25 years old.</p><h3><strong>Zachary Shipman Job</strong></h3><p>Zachary Shipman is the proprietor of the Selma, Alabama-based Vasser’s Mini Mart. The journal claims that Chase Shipman also owns a nearby gas and oil business. Previously, his parents had managed both companies for almost 20 years.</p><p>The Google reviews for the business before the riverboat incident were mixed but contained many positive reviews. “The dressing was not dressing.. it was plain cornbread… The greens were canned greens & it’s tore my stomach up..” one person wrote. But another person wrote a year ago, “Good biscuit breakfast sandwiches. Dinner plates are slam full and yummy. We will be back.”</p><p>However, as a result of complaints about the riverboat incident, the establishment only has one star presently on Yelp. One woman wrote, “Just good ol boys, never meaning no harm, eh? I hope they run you all out of business!”</p><p>Yelp has suspended comments on the page. “This business recently received increased public attention resulting in an influx of people posting their views to this page, so we have temporarily disabled the ability to post here as we work to investigate the content,” Yelp wrote.</p><h3><strong>Is Zachary Shipman On Facebook?</strong></h3><p>Yes, Zachary Shipman was on <a href=#>Facebook</a> but the profile has since been deleted.</p><h3><strong>Zachary Shipman Girlfriend</strong></h3><p>The relationship details of Zachary Shipman are unclear.</p><h3><strong>Zachary Shipman Parents</strong></h3><p>Zachary Shipman’s mother is named Melissa “Missy” Calvert. Missy is 51 years old. On July 13, 2023, he took to Facebook to congratulate his mother for passing her state board tests as a licensed massage therapist.</p><p>His dad Jamie Calvert has passed away. Jamie was 55 years of age and was born on July 20, 1966, to James Leonard Calvert and Norma Jean Calvert. His father was the owner of&nbsp;Vasser’s Mini Mart, which was damaged by the tornado that ravaged Selma on January 12, 2023.</p><p>According to a Selma Times-Journal report from June 2023, “Chase Shipman is the new owner at Vassers. Shipman, 25, bought the business from his mother, Missy Calvert, on June 16.”</p><p>Zachary told the newspaper, “My parents have done this for the last 19 years. father passed away several years ago and I was working for the railroad. My mom wanted me to come in and learn the business because eventually he one day wanted to hand the business off to me. I started learning everything I could. I figured if I started learning at a young age and it took off like I was hoping then I could turn it into something good and possibly expand it. She was ready to sit back a little bit and sit watch. She will still help out a little bit but I decided it was now or never.”</p><p>Zachary has one sister named Celia Calvert.</p><h3><strong>Related FAQs</strong></h3><ul><li><h4><strong>Where Is Zachary Shipman From?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Zachary Shipman hailed from Selma, Alabama.</p><ul><li><h4><strong>When Is Zachary Shipman Birthday?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Zachary Shipman’s birthday is not available at this moment.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifn6jAqrzNnq%2BtnJ%2Bkv2%2BvzqZms5mTna6zxYysn6KonZa7bq3GnmSjp5Jirq2twZqkmmWSpK61ecGrmLCkXay1sHnIrGShnV8%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fzachary-shipman-age-job-alabama-boat-brawl-who-is-he.html&text=Who%20Is%20Zachary%20Shipman%3f%20His%20Age%2c%20Job&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fzachary-shipman-age-job-alabama-boat-brawl-who-is-he.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fzachary-shipman-age-job-alabama-boat-brawl-who-is-he.html&title=Who%20Is%20Zachary%20Shipman%3f%20His%20Age%2c%20Job" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fzachary-shipman-age-job-alabama-boat-brawl-who-is-he.html&title=Who%20Is%20Zachary%20Shipman%3f%20His%20Age%2c%20Job" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fzachary-shipman-age-job-alabama-boat-brawl-who-is-he.html&title=Who%20Is%20Zachary%20Shipman%3f%20His%20Age%2c%20Job" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fzachary-shipman-age-job-alabama-boat-brawl-who-is-he.html&description=Who%20Is%20Zachary%20Shipman%3f%20His%20Age%2c%20Job" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./zulily-layoffs.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Zulily Layoffs  Zulily Job Cuts and Business Future">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./who-is-ainsley-earhardts-ex-husband-heres-why-fox-friends-host-split-from-will-proctor-after-7-years-of-marriage.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who is Ainsley Earhardt's ex-husband?
