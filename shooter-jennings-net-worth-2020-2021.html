If you do not know, We have prepared this article about details of Shooter Jennings’s short biography-wiki, career, professional life, personal life, today’s net worth, age, height, weight, and more facts. Well, if you’re ready, let’s start.</p><h2>Early Life</h2><p>Shooter Jennings was born on 19 May 1979 in the Nashville city of Tennessee, United States. His father, Waylon Jennings, and mother, Jessi Colter, were both legends of the musical world. He spent his initial life in a cradle of a bus and was always surrounded by musical stars, like Kris Kristofferson, Willie Nelson, and Johnny Cash. Probably this was the reason that merely at the age of 5, Shooter started playing drums. He began his piano lessons at the age of 8, and at 14, he began to play the guitar.</p><p>When he was in high school, he formed a rock band by the name of “KilRaven.” With the album, “Missed The Boat,” he launched the Kilraven track, “Only You” in 2011. In 1996, for the first time, Shooter recorded an album together with his dad. The album was named “Fenixon,” but it failed to find a distributor and so was not released at that time. In 2014, the full version of “Fenixon” was released by the “Black Country Rock” of Shooter.</p><h2>Personal Life</h2><p>In 2003, Shooter Jennings began to date an American actor, Drea de Matteo, and after four years in 2007, they were blessed to have a daughter named Alabama Gypsyrose Jennings. In 2011, the couple was again blessed to have a son named Waylon Albert “Blackjack” Jennings. The couple, however, never got married and finally ended their relationship. On 4 June 2013, Shooter married actor, Misty Brooke Swain in the Joshua Tree city of California.</p><h2>Age, Height, and Weight</h2><p>Being born on 19 May 1979, Shooter Jennings is 45 years old as of today’s date 20th July 2024.

By the end of 2001, Shooter and other “Stargunn” artists released their first album, “The Only Way Up Is Down.” In 2002, when his father died, he sang the song, “I’ve Always Been Crazy,” as a tribute to him. On 30 March 2003, Shooter left “Stargunn” and began to work as a solo singer.</p><p>In 2005, in a contract with Show Dog-Universal Music, he released his first album, “Put the “O” Back in Country.” The album became so famous that it got the 22nd position in the “Hot Country Songs” list released by Billboard.

After leaving Universal, the name of Shooter’s band was changed from “The .357’s” to “Hierophant.” The fifth album of Shooter called “Black Ribbons” was released on 20 March 2010 with his band “Hierophant.” By the end of 2010, a movement called “XXX” was launched by Shooter and many other artists. The aim of the movement was to assist musicians who wrestle to get mainstream identification.</p><p>On 13 March 2012, Shooter released his sixth album, “Family Man,” in a contract with E1 Music and The Triple Crown. On 31 July 2012, he appeared in the first single singer, Bucky Covington, titled “The Drinking Side of Country.” When the album, “Family Man” was being recorded, a part of it was trimmed and inserted in the then-upcoming album of Shooter: “The Other Life.”</p><p>With the help of filmmaker Blake Judd, Shooter released a 32-minute horror movie, “The Other Life.” It was based on his album of the same name and played six songs from the album. The shooter also entertains on a radio show called “Electric Rodeo” on “SiriusXM’s Outlaw Country station.” The show airs at night every Thursday, Saturday, and Sunday and focuses mainly on rock, country, and outlaw music.</p><h2>Awards and Achievements</h2><p>As a singer, Shooter Jennings has not received any award to date, but many of his tracks have been in the list of Billboard’s Hot country songs.
