However, the marriage ended just three years later. The reason for the duo’s divorce is said to be the comedian’s philandering, alcohol, and drugs issue.&nbsp;&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>During the 1980s and early 1990s, Ferguson was reportedly at his worst. He could barely keep up with the job. He got into drugs to cope with professional failure. The award-winning host explained how difficult this time was for him.&nbsp;</p><p>I woke up in a storage room over a London bar, covered in my own vomit and pee...I was almost thirty, divorced, and broke. I couldn’t even make it to Scotland to be with my parents at Christmas.</p><p>A few years later, the Scotland-born American comedian gave love and marriage another shot. In 1998, he got hitched to Sascha Corwin. The television host has a son, Milo, from his marriage with Corwin.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Unfortunately, the couple split in 2004.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>After his second marriage failed, the comedian got&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">married</a>&nbsp;to art dealer Cunningham in 2008. And for Ferguson, the third time seems to have done the charm. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-169 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>A Secret Wedding, A Lifesaving Union</h2><p>Ferguson and Cunningham got&nbsp;married&nbsp;in a private wedding ceremony in Vermont. They somehow kept their marriage a secret for some time.&nbsp;</p><p>So, when Ferguson announced his wedding on his late-night show, fans were utterly&nbsp;shocked. Continuing, the host also showed off his wedding ring and a wedding picture with his spouse.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>The wedding took place in Vermont, where they have legalized gay civil unions – and I married a woman. It’s not just bling.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Three years after tying the knot, the couple welcomed their son Liam in 2011.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2017, the father of two&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">shared</a>&nbsp;on&nbsp;The Howard Stern Show&nbsp;that his present wife saved him from going down the rabbit hole. He was thankful to Cunningham as she was the primary reason for his sobriety.</p><p>He admitted that there was a time when he was drinking so much, he’d forget a lot of what he did during the day, but all of that was in the past, and he was now a better man, all thanks to his wife. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>Once we got together, that was it. I think it (the third marriage) saved me, to be honest. I think I would have made a fool of myself.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGipnqSRqbawutKhoKlnk6euqrOMn5yrn6WovK950qmmrquVYsSqssRnn62lnA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fcraig-ferguson-spouse-wife-html.html&text=Craig%20Ferguson%27s%20Third%20Marriage%20with%20Wife%20Megan%20Saved%20the%20Former%20Later%20Night%20Host&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fcraig-ferguson-spouse-wife-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fcraig-ferguson-spouse-wife-html.html&title=Craig%20Ferguson%27s%20Third%20Marriage%20with%20Wife%20Megan%20Saved%20the%20Former%20Later%20Night%20Host" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fcraig-ferguson-spouse-wife-html.html&title=Craig%20Ferguson%27s%20Third%20Marriage%20with%20Wife%20Megan%20Saved%20the%20Former%20Later%20Night%20Host" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fcraig-ferguson-spouse-wife-html.html&title=Craig%20Ferguson%27s%20Third%20Marriage%20with%20Wife%20Megan%20Saved%20the%20Former%20Later%20Night%20Host" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fcraig-ferguson-spouse-wife-html.html&description=Craig%20Ferguson%27s%20Third%20Marriage%20with%20Wife%20Megan%20Saved%20the%20Former%20Later%20Night%20Host" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./crystal-waters-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Crystal Waters Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./christina-hendricks-net-worth-2020-2021.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Christina HendricksNet Worth 2024: Age, Height, Weight, Husband, Kids, Bio-Wiki">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
