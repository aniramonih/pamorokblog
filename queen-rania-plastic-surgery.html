She looks very young and fresh which people believe is due to Botox, fillers, and a facelift. There were also rumors that she got a nose job. While some believe Queen Rania has had plastic surgery to look young, some think that it's just makeup and styling that's making all the difference.</strong></p><p><strong>Queen Rania</strong> of Jordan is believed by many to be one of the most beautiful women in the world. She dazzled and enchanted everyone with her beauty when she was young and is still continuing to do so at 52. She does not look much different as she was back then, which has led people to believe she has had plastic surgery. Beauty with age is expensive and she is a <a href=#><strong>queen</strong></a> so, she has all the means to afford that. That is why many choose to believe she has had work done than that she is natural.</p><p>Here's everything to know about Queen Rania's plastic surgery!</p><p>There are more <strong><a href=#>plastic surgery</a></strong> stories of <a href=#><strong>Ms Sethi</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Kanye West's mom</strong></a> that you might be interested in.</p><h2>Has Queen Rania Had Plastic Surgery to Look Young?</h2><p><strong>Queen Rania</strong> (<a href=# rel=noopener>@queenrania</a>) of Jordan is suspected by people of having plastic surgery to maintain her youthful look. She is believed to have had <strong>Botox</strong>, <strong>fillers</strong>, and a <strong>facelift</strong>. There are also rumors of her getting a <strong>nose job</strong>.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/houseandwhips.com/storage/2023/06/queen-rania-pic1.jpg alt="Queen Rania of Jordan appears to have had plastic surgery to look young. houseandwhips.com " width=1280 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><strong>Queen Rania of Jordan appears to have had plastic surgery to look young.</strong><br><strong>Image Source: Hola</strong></p><p>If you didn't know, it's a very joyous time right now in Jordan because they are celebrating the wedding ceremony of <strong>Crown Prince Hussein</strong> (the eldest son and heir of <strong>King Abdullah II</strong> and Queen Rania) and <strong>Rajwa Khaled bin</strong> <strong>Musaed bin Saif bin Abdulaziz Al Saif</strong>. After they announced their engagement in August, everyone was anticipating a grand wedding.</p><p>And the couple didn't disappoint. They <a href=# rel=noopener>got married in a lavish wedding ceremony</a>, full of grandeur. It was a spectacular event, very befitting for the royals. But all of the magnificence and decor were no match for Queen Rania because it was she who took the spotlight with her radiance and youthfulness. The crown prince's mother beguiled everyone who watched the ceremony as they noted how young she still looked at 52. You could anticipate the plastic surgery speculations coming.</p><p>She looked angelic in a <a href=# rel=noopener>black and gold Dior Couture gown</a> with a high collar and wide cuffs. The gold embellishments at the neckline and wrists elevated her look. She paired the dress with a gold top-handle handbag and completed her look, that was the talk of the ceremony. Nobody could take their eyes off her during the event because she was that enchanting but as soon as the ceremony was over, people went on Google to search for Queen Rania's plastic surgery because it was unreal how stunning and young she looked.</p><h2>What Plastic Surgery Did Queen Rania Get to Look Young?</h2><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/houseandwhips.com/storage/2023/06/queen-rania-pic2.jpg alt="Queen Rania is believed to have had plastic surgery including Botox, fillers, and a facelift. houseandwhips.com " width=1280 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><strong>Queen Rania is believed to have had plastic surgery including Botox, fillers, and a facelift.</strong><br><strong>Image Source: Vogue</strong></p><p>Now, she's a royal. So, you can't expect <strong>Queen Rania</strong> of Jordan to open up about the plastic surgery procedures she had if she had any. But being a royal does not exempt her from being speculated to have cosmetic procedures and people believe she has had help in aging 'gracefully' such as Botox, fillers, and a facelift.</p><p>If anybody looks as young and fresh as she does when they are 52, in the era of plastic surgery, nobody's going to believe they are all-natural. The same thing applies to Queen Rania as well. Besides, if you look at her, she doesn't look like she hasn't had work done. She definitely looks as though she has enhanced her features with some cosmetic procedures. But while it's not very visible as they would normally be when the procedures are botched, they are still noticeable and not very subtle.</p><p>Many royal watchers believe that Queen Rania's flawless and wrinkle-less face gives away that she has had Botox injections. Like it's not natural to not even have a single crease when you have crossed your fifties. Also, when she smiles, her cheeks look so plump. I mean, they look fuller than when she was young. That's not possible without the fillers, right? Her youthful look has to be due to plastic surgery.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/houseandwhips.com/storage/2023/06/queen-rania-pic2-1.jpg alt="Some believe Queen Rania looks young because of her makeup and fashion choices. houseandwhips.com " width=1280 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><strong>Some believe Queen Rania looks young because of her makeup and fashion choices.</strong><br><strong>Image Source: Harper's Bazaar Arabia</strong></p><p>It's not a stretch to think she may have had a facelift as well. She must have gotten the plastic surgery to lift her face before aging could make it sag. In getting all these cosmetic procedures, she essentially bought her youth back because there's no way anyone could tell that she is 52 just by looking at her face. She really could pass off as a woman in her early thirties. Besides, there were also rumors of her getting a nose job to make her nose narrower and slimmer. There are a few pictures of her when she was young with a much wider nose. Now, she has a perfectly slim nose. Cosmetic surgery is just magical.</p><p>Or is it? While some have a very strong belief that Queen Rania looks as young as she does because of plastic surgery, some still think she is natural and her youthful look is all due to her makeup and styling choices. They argue that she looks like she has had a makeover rather than cosmetic surgery. Her fashion and makeup style has evolved since she became a Queen to make her look better and younger, some believe.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6rApq3Nna6hoaCoe6S7zGiorp2Vo3qzrc2imGaonJbAtbXCZqquqpeav7p7</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fqueen-rania-plastic-surgery.html&text=How%20Does%20She%20Still%20Look%20So%20Young%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fqueen-rania-plastic-surgery.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fqueen-rania-plastic-surgery.html&title=How%20Does%20She%20Still%20Look%20So%20Young%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fqueen-rania-plastic-surgery.html&title=How%20Does%20She%20Still%20Look%20So%20Young%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fqueen-rania-plastic-surgery.html&title=How%20Does%20She%20Still%20Look%20So%20Young%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fqueen-rania-plastic-surgery.html&description=How%20Does%20She%20Still%20Look%20So%20Young%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./the-queen-how-long-on-the-throne-reign.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="How long was Queen Elizabeth II on the throne?
