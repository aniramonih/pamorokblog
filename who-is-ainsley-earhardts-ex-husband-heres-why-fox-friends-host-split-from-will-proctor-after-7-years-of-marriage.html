At the time, the divorce announcement still caused a mild controversy when both of them commented on it.</p><p><b>Also Read</b>:</p><h2 class=split>Who is Will Proctor?&nbsp;</h2><p>Proctor did not first come to fame when he was associated with the Fox News star. He has had his fair share of popularity for being involved in college sports. As part of Clemson University, he represented the Clemson Tigers as their starting quarterback. He was celebrated in the college football scene when he actively played around the years 2003 until 2008. He eventually got signed by the Calgary Stampeders until his retirement from the sport in 2008.&nbsp;</p><p>Proctor attended the Winter Park Trinity Prep school as he hailed from Winter Park, Florida.

They also decided to live close to each other in New York City so it is convenient for them to take care of their child. "We're focusing on moving ahead and raising our daughter," Earhardt told People in 2019, "We honestly wish each other nothing but the best, and we will remain friends for the rest of our lives because we share this precious, beautiful daughter together.
