His friend Woody Harrelson staged two interventions to try and save him. And while most of us thought that Owen was in the hospital in the week before Labor Day, The Enquirer claims he was holed up at Harrelson’s house for several days.</p><p>Owen’s recent depression also had nothing to do with his split from Kate Hudson or with her high-profile romance with Dax Shephard, according to the Enquirer. As is consistent with other reports, they say that he was the one who broke up with Kate, that he didn’t regret it, and that it was an argument with a friend over a business matter that left him distraught:</p><p>An in-depth Enquirer investigation also reveals stunning new details about the story that has rocked Hollywood, including the fact that the deeply troubled star was on a deadly drug cocktail in the months before his most recent suicide attempt, mixing illegal drugs with antidepressants and Valium.</p><p>As Owen spiraled downward into drug use and depression, his close friend Woody Harrelson tried two interventions to save him.</p><p>“This isn’t the first time Owen tried to commit suicide,” a family friend revealed exclusively to the Enquirer.</p><p>“A good portion of his life has been dedicated to fighting depression and addiction. Owen’s been on and off drugs for years – and this is actually the <i>third</i> time he’s tried killing himself…”</p><p>The Enquirer has learned that Owen secretly has been plagued by many career and personal demons for a long time, but was sent hurtling toward the edge by a huge fight with a close friend, who was working with him on a movie project, say sources.</p><p>The comedy star’s failure to write any material for the production triggered the clash…</p><p>While most of the world thought Owen was still in Cedars-Sinai Medical Center – where he was transferred after being treated at Saint John’s Health Center – The Enquirer learned he quietly checked out on Wednesday, August 29, at around 11 am and went to Woody’s Beverly Hills home, where he stayed for several days…</p><p>Contrary to reports elsewhere, Owen’s breakup with Kate Hudson is not what pushed him over the edge. In fact, it was Owen who ended that relationship…</p><p>The actor also started taking a popular antidepressant – which can have devastating side effects, according [sic] a source close to the case. The antidepressant was legally prescribed to him…</p><p>The side effects of the antidepressant could well have triggered Owen’s suicide attempt, say medical experts contact by The Enquirer.</p><p>[From The National Enquirer print edition, September 17, 2007]</p><p>Several commentors mentioned here that while a lot of people were surprised over Owen’s suicide attempt, it just brought home how common and hidden depression can be. Commentor Amanda said “I have read numerous reports about people saying he doesn’t seem like the type. There is no type. My best friend killed himself 13 months ago and he was the last person you would think would do it. I also deal with manic depression and no one would guess that I am depressed let alone that I nearly killed myself 6 months ago. Point being just because someone appears happy and ‘normal’ doesn’t mean they are.”</p><p>After hearing those type of stories, I guess it’s not surprising that Owen had earlier attempts. He seems to have a good support system with his two brothers and good friends like Woody and I hope he makes it through to the other side soon. He seems like a very good guy, and he’s quite talented. We would love for him to continuing entertaining us well into his old age, if that’s what he wants to do.</p><p>If you or a friend or family member is depressed please talk about it and get help. Owen’s case shows us that you shouldn’t wait until it’s too late, and thank goodness he didn’t do permanent damage.</p><p>Header image is an older one, thanks to <a href=#>Splash News</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmirJOdxm%2BvzqZmbm9oZnyww8SnlrChnKi8r6vWmqqYp56Uu6bDvpqlraGUmr2zsdKsmKesj52upavTsKaYnZGnuaqx0ZiqrqGTnrGmq8Ctq56loKnAcA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fowen-wilson-was-on-new-antidepressant-had-two-earlier-suicide-attempts.html&text=Owen%20Wilson%20was%20on%20new%20antidepressant%2c%20had%20two%20earlier%20suicide%20attempts&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fowen-wilson-was-on-new-antidepressant-had-two-earlier-suicide-attempts.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fowen-wilson-was-on-new-antidepressant-had-two-earlier-suicide-attempts.html&title=Owen%20Wilson%20was%20on%20new%20antidepressant%2c%20had%20two%20earlier%20suicide%20attempts" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fowen-wilson-was-on-new-antidepressant-had-two-earlier-suicide-attempts.html&title=Owen%20Wilson%20was%20on%20new%20antidepressant%2c%20had%20two%20earlier%20suicide%20attempts" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fowen-wilson-was-on-new-antidepressant-had-two-earlier-suicide-attempts.html&title=Owen%20Wilson%20was%20on%20new%20antidepressant%2c%20had%20two%20earlier%20suicide%20attempts" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fowen-wilson-was-on-new-antidepressant-had-two-earlier-suicide-attempts.html&description=Owen%20Wilson%20was%20on%20new%20antidepressant%2c%20had%20two%20earlier%20suicide%20attempts" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./penelope-cruz-endlessly-toned-legs-mini-dress-star-studded-red-carpet.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Penelope Cruz stuns on star-studded red carpet in chic pink mini-dress">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./natalie-weber-separada-relationship-marido-mauro.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Natalie Weber Separada: Relationship With Her Marido Mauro Zrate">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
