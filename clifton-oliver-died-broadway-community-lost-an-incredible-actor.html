I’m so grateful for your friendship. Here’s one of my favorite moments, when he came to my high school to sing with us. Rest in Peace, Clifton.</p><p><strong>Dewitt Cooper Shared a Post on Facebook sharing Memoria of Oliver by writing:-</strong></p><p>My baby brother, Clifton Oliver, has had his final curtain call. It was peaceful. His partner Richard, was singing to him the song Psalm 23 as <strong>he took his last breath this morning at 3:20 AM.</strong> He had a Gorgeous smile on his Beautiful face!! He went twirling into the afterlife ready to make his Grand Appearance as the Star of his Homecoming Celebration! My heart is sad, and overjoyed at the same time! I will miss him, but he is finally at peace! He brought so much light to this world! He brought so much light to my life! He impacted the lives of people throughout the world as he showcased his amazing talent, kind soul, and loving spirit to EVERYONE he met! He will be missed, but never forgotten! He lives within all of us! As the song goes in one of his most prominent roles of Simba in the Lion King on Broadway, He Lives In Me! I will value my time with him the last six weeks of his life that I spent at his bedside in the hospital and then finally hospice. I was able to love on my baby brother, and I will always cherish the memories of having an honor and privilege to do just that! There will be more information to come, as we begin to plan the Celebration of<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> Clifton Olive</a>r!</p><p><strong>Moya Angela wrote a heart felt Post on Facebook:-</strong></p><p>It is with a very heavy heart that I have to post this news about our brother Clifton Oliver. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Clifton Oliver</a>:</p><p>Clifton has had his final curtain call.
