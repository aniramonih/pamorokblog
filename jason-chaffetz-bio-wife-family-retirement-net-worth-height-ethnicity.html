Chaffetz and Margaret A.&nbsp;Wood in Los Gatos, California.&nbsp;However, his father’s work as a businessman meant that the family moved a lot during his childhood.&nbsp;Jason ended up growing up in multiple states like California, Arizona, and Colorado.&nbsp;Jason Chaffetz was born to a Jewish father and was raised Jewish, although he is currently a Mormon.</span></p><p><span>For his education, Jason Chaffetz attended a few schools due to his parents’ relocation.&nbsp;He attended high school in California and Colorado, where he graduated from Middle Park High School and attended Brigham Young University.&nbsp;During his college years, his faith changed greatly as he transitioned from Judaism to Mormonism and his political views shifted from Democratic to Republican philosophies.</span></p><span>After graduating from college in 1989, worked for 10 years as a public relations officer for Nu Skin International, a multi-level marketing company;&nbsp;He met former US President Ronald Reagan while he was at Nu Skin.&nbsp;His meeting with Ronald Reagan cemented his belief in Republican ideals.&nbsp;After serving in the private sector for over a decade, Jason Chaffetz still had ambitions in the public service and applied to join the United States Secret Service in 2003, but was turned down due to poor qualifications.&nbsp;The following year he helped Jon Huntsman win the race for Utah governor and he was named chief of staff.</span><p><span>He announced his intentions for the 2008 House of Representatives election in 2007 and campaigned for the Republican ticket alongside Chris Cannon and David Leavitt.&nbsp;On primary election night, Chaffetz defeated Democratic nominee Bennion Spencer.</span></p><p><span>Since taking office in 2009, Jason has taken a notable stand on important policies and legislation such as the Affordable Care Act.&nbsp;As a representative, his conservative leanings have sparked several controversies, including his opposition to climate change and opposition to same-sex marriage.</span></p><p><span>He is also opposed to the proposed net neutrality parenting and the exoneration of National Public Radio.&nbsp;Jason was a vocal critic of President Obama and a staunch supporter of Donald Trump, who voted for him in the 2016 election.&nbsp;During his time as a congressman, he served on a number of committees, including the Judiciary Committee and the Oversight and Government Reform Committee.&nbsp;He is a published author with three books and is a regular contributor to Fox News.</span></p><h2><strong><span>his resignation</span></strong></h2><p><span>Jason Chaffetz announced his resignation from the House of Representatives on April 19, 2017, on his doctor’s recommendation for an injury he sustained in 2006.&nbsp;He was originally scheduled to end his term without re-election, but the severity of the injury forced him to retire on the 18th of May 2017.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Wealth (income and earnings)</span></strong></h2><p><span>Jason Chaffetz has been able to build a comfortable life through his life in private business and his public life as a congressman.&nbsp;Today, he has a net worth of $3 million, which is further maintained by a lucrative gig on Fox News.&nbsp;He currently resides in a $1 million home with his family.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Jason Chaffetz’s wife and family</span></strong></h2><p><span>Jason Chaffetz met his wife, Julie Johnson, while he was at Brigham Young University.&nbsp;The two were students at the school at the time and eventually married after graduating in February 1991.
