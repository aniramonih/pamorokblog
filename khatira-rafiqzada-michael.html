October 2012 is the day of their happy wedding and the venue in Los Angeles. They got married within a couple of close friends and relatives. They revealed the information about their marriage later in December 2012 as they are enjoying their new marital days.</p><p>The two still celebrate a strong bond. The love between them has not diminished but has grown and flourished much and more day by day. They do share a lot of memories of traveling together all around.
