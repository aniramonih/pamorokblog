col-md-offset-1"><article role=main class=blog-post><p><span>Best known as Chucky, Hirving Lozano is a young professional footballer who plays for the Mexican national team as well as Dutch club PSV Eindhoven.&nbsp;Although still very young, the winger showed a lot of promise and talent which prompted him to play in the 2018 FIFA World Cup to represent Mexico.&nbsp;Here’s what you need to know about him.</span></p><h2><strong><span>the biography</span></strong></h2><p><span>Born on July 30, 1995 as Hirving Rodrigo Lozano Bahena in Mexico City, the footballer was raised alongside his brother in a family and not very pleasant origins.</span></p><p><span>Since he was just a kid, he had already started to make his way with his love for football.&nbsp;This is one of the things that led to him being nicknamed Chucky due to how dangerous he could be against an opponent.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Club football career</span></strong></h2><p><span>Lozano started his career as a youth player with Pachuca in 2009 when he was just 14 years old.&nbsp;He remained with the Mexican professional soccer team until 2014 when he was promoted to the senior team.</span></p><p><span>At the 2016 Olympics, the youngster was linked with Manchester United, although the deal didn’t materialize at the end of the day.&nbsp;Instead, he was back with the team he played until 2017 when he joined Dutch side PSV Eindhoven.&nbsp;Since signing a 6-year contract with the team, he has played 29 games scoring 17 goals at the end of his first season.</span></p><p><span>As in his club football career, he won numerous titles, including Liga MX: Clausura and the CONCACAF Champions League with Pachuca, while also winning the Eredivisie with PSV.</span></p><h2><strong><span>National football career</span></strong></h2><p><span>Even though age is still with him, the story of Hirving Lozano in the Mexican jersey is rather long and interesting.&nbsp;He made his debut for the Under-20s and Under-22s in 2015, before heading to the 2016 Olympics to fly the country’s flag.&nbsp;At the tournament he played 3 games and came home with 3 goals.</span></p><p><span>His call up to the national team was in 2016 and he had his first match against Senegal in a friendly match.&nbsp;From then on, he appeared in Mexican colors in the 2018 FIFA World Cup qualifiers as well as the 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup.</span></p><p><span>By the time he was named as part of the 28-man preliminary squad to represent Mexico at the 2018 FIFA World Cup, Hirving Lozano had already played 25 times for the country and he scored 7 goals, including a winner having allowed Russia not to participate in the 2017 Confederations Cup.</span></p><p><span>The winger recorded personal accolades like the Golden Boot at the CONCACAF Under-20 Championship in 2015, while building the best team of eleven.&nbsp;In the same year, Hirving Lozano also won the CONCACAF Men’s Olympic Qualifying Championship Golden Ball and made the team of the best eleven team.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Hirving Lozano’s family</span></strong></h2><p><span>Lozano comes from a very small family and was raised alongside his brother by their parents, Jesus Lozano (Father) and his mother, Ana María Bahena.&nbsp;His father is a face that is not very absent from his young son’s football career as he has mostly had a say in what Lozano does.</span></p><p><span>As noted, he has a younger brother called Bryan Mauricio Lozano Bahena who, unsurprisingly, is also a footballer.&nbsp;Young Lozano was born on March 20, 1997 and plays as a midfielder for Club Universidad Nacional.</span></p><p><span>The footballer also started his own family being already married.&nbsp;The name of his wife who remained rather elusive is Ana Obregón.&nbsp;The pair met while Hirving was playing Pachuca.</span></p><p><span>Shortly after meeting, they decided to tie the knot when the footballer was 18 years old.&nbsp;After revealing the importance he places on his family, the Mexican player has two children with his wife.&nbsp;Their first child, a daughter, was born to him in 2014, while the second, a son, was born in 2017.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Height, weight, measurements</span></strong></h2><p><span>The Mexican midfielder will easily thicken the box when it comes to agility and skill, it’s even because he won’t make it the most physical of teams.&nbsp;That said, he is still athletic and has an average height and good body weight.&nbsp;Looking at the measurements, he is 1.75m (5ft 8′in) tall and weighs 70kg (154lbs).</span></p><p><span>For his general body measurements, this has not yet been provided, but there can be little argument about his fitness to play football.</span></p><p class=postsid
