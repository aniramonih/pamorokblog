The film industry began gaining popularity back in the early 1900s and has continued growing ever since. The film industry can be considered as one of the most dominant fields in the entertainment sector.</p><p>The film industry has grown alongside the growth of technology. As new technologies are emerging, such as better cameras and improved computer capabilities, so is the film industry growing. The creative side of the film industry cannot be overlooked. The creative thinking going on within the brains behind the cameras is amazing.</p><p>New types of films and shows are being introduced every now and then. It is very incredible how so many new ideas are always emerging every day. Well, the creative brainstorming that I am crediting has attracted viewers all over the world to get a glimpse of the new concepts of filming that are being introduced. An example of such new concepts is the filming of adventurous live events.</p><p>This concept has been practiced by many people and has also been actualized by many. &nbsp;An example of people who have experimented with this concept is the cast of Wicked Tuna. They film all their incredible fishing activities and all the challenges they go through to net a good catch. The show has attracted so many viewers, and he been quite successful.</p><h2>Inception</h2><p>The show has been airing on National Geographic since the 1st&nbsp;of April in 2012. The show basically has a very simple concept. The show is about commercial tuna fishermen who are based in Gloucester, Massachusetts. These commercial fishermen are good at what they do, and they make the best and biggest catches. These teams of fishermen compete against each other to make the biggest catches and get the best deals on their catches.</p><p>These fishermen go out to get the lucrative Atlantic Bluefin tuna, which is very marketable in the area. The fish caught by these fishermen are huge and make deals of even up to $10,000. The teams compete in the vast North Atlantic Ocean, where the number of Bluefin tuna is large.</p><p>These fishermen are also armed with sophisticated machines and equipment that enable them to catch even the biggest tuna that they might encounter. Their boats are equipped with tracking systems that are able to locate the fish that they wish to catch. With their fish of choice already targeted, a traditional hook and bait method is applied to attract the fish, but once the fish is trapped by the hook, there is no chance of escaping, the fish is no match for their sophisticated equipment.</p><p>Once it is caught, the fish is taken back to shore, where the deals and trading are done. The show is very exciting and attracts millions of viewers who are tuned in to the National Geographic channel. There is a lot of action when the fishermen wrestle with the fish, and the adventurous theme of the show is very attractive.</p><p>These teams of fishermen do not only compete to catch the biggest fish, but also play a very big role in the conservation of the Bluefin tuna. The captains of the boats make sure that they adhere to the size and age limitations of the tuna to be caught. The captains also make sure that they adhere to the quotas of the seasons. This helps to maintain the amount of Bluefin tuna in the North Atlantic Ocean.</p><p>It can be said that the show has been advocating for the conservation of the Bluefin tuna fish, which faces a lot of challenges against fishermen that catch fish that have not yet matured. They also use non-destructive methods of catching fish other than the other methods that are harmful such as using chemicals that are harmful to fish.</p><h2>Evolution</h2><p>The show has grown in immense popularity among all the viewers that are able to access National Geographic. The showâ€™s mixture of action and adventure is an attractive feature of the show. &nbsp;After the show making its debut on the 1st&nbsp;of April in 2012, the show has had unprecedented success. The show has run continuously for eight seasons, and the ninth season is set to be renewed by the National Geographic Channel. The ninth season is highly anticipated by its viewers all over the world.</p><h2>Awards & Achievements</h2><p>Wicked Tuna has become a very popular reality TV show with a unique approach to showbiz. This creative approach and earned quite a number of viewers and also some awards and acknowledgments. Apart from the money that the show makes, they have also been acknowledged for the work that they have accomplished. Although there are no medals for what they have done, the winners of Wicked Tuna still remain with the bragging rights.</p><h2>Net Worth of Wicked Tuna in 2024</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.wealthypersons.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Wicked-Tuna-Net-Worth.jpg><p>The Wicked Tuna show is a very popular reality TV show that has been airing for quite a long time.
