Jose Canseco has been through a lot, but one thing is certain: despite the different hardships he faced as a player, he always gave it his all.</p><p>The Oakland Athletics were his finest team, and they provided him with the opportunity to establish himself as a premier power hitter. To name a few of his completions as a player, he won Rookie of the Year in 1986 and the Most Valuable Award in 1988, to name a few.</p><p>So, now let’s discuss more Jose Canseco’s life and his net worth!</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Jose Canseco Early Life:</h2><figure class="wp-block-table is-style-stripes"><table class=has-fixed-layout><tbody readability=0.912><tr><td>Full Real Name</td><td>Jose Canseco</td></tr><tr><td>Family Name</td><td>Jose</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Profession</td><td>Amateur wrestler and Martial Artist</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td><a href=#>July 2nd, 1964</a></td></tr><tr><td>Age</td><td>57</td></tr><tr><td>Birthday</td><td><a href=#>July 2nd</a></td></tr><tr><td>Year Of Birth</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Nick Name</td><td>Jose</td></tr><tr><td>Current Residence</td><td>Havana, Cuba</td></tr><tr><td>Country</td><td>United States</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p>Jose Canseco’s life was not without its ups and downs. Things were well for him until Fidel Castro came to power on July 2nd, 1964 when he was born a Cuban. His father, who worked as a territory manager and a part-time teacher for an oil and gas company, lost his job and eventually lost his home. Jose and his twin brother Ozzie were just one year old when their <a href=#>family</a> was granted permission to leave Cuba in 1965.</p><p>They transferred to the United States and were persistent in the Miami area, where their father landed a job as a territory manager with another oil and gasoline company, Amoco. He was compelled to work part-time as a security guard to meet all of his family’s demands.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Jose Canseco Education:</h2><figure class="wp-block-table is-style-stripes"><table class=has-fixed-layout><tbody readability=1><tr><td>Highest Qualification</td><td>Diploma</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>High School</td><td>Miami Coral Park High School</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p>Given that Jose Canseco began playing baseball at a relatively young age, little is known about his education. He enrolled at Miami Coral Park <a href=#>High School</a>, close to their home. He joined the school’s baseball team, and his coach was pleased with him. After many years of trying, he finally made it onto the varsity team during his senior year. He was named the junior varsity team’s Most Valuable Player during his junior year. A year later, he was on the varsity team. He received his diploma in 1982.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Jose Canseco Family:</h2><figure class="wp-block-table is-style-stripes"><table class=has-fixed-layout><tbody><tr><td>Father</td><td>Jose Sr.</td></tr><tr><td>Mother</td><td>Barbara Canseco</td></tr><tr><td>Brothers</td><td>Ozzie</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p>Jose Canseco’s father’s name is Jose Sr., And his mother’s name is Barbara Canseco.

He is thought to be single now, but that doesn’t mean he hasn’t tried his luck in love. He has drenched his toe in the water twice, but neither marriage has worked out for him. His first marriage was to Esther Haddad, and they were married on October 25, 1988. It didn’t work out this time, and they split up on November 25, 1992.</p><p>Jose chose to get into another relationship after his previous marriage failed, and this time he fell in love with Jessica Canseco, a waitress at Hooters in Cleveland. They married on August 17, 1996, and their daughter, Josie Marie, was born in October of the same year.</p><p>Their wedding did not last long, as they filed for divorce in 1999, and it was finalized in 2000.

He began dating Leila Knight; however, after their engagement, Leila called off the relationship in a November 2014 TMZ <a href=#>interview</a>.
