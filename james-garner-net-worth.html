James Garner was best known for his starring roles on such television series as "Maverick" and "The Rockford Files." He was also a leading man in numerous movies over the decades, including "The Great Escape," "Grand Prix," "Marlowe," and "Murphy's Romance," for which he earned an Academy Award nomination. Later, in the 2000s, Garner appeared in films such as "Space Cowboys" and "The Notebook."</p><h2 id=early-life-military-service><strong>Early Life and Military Service</strong></h2><p>James Garner was born as James Scott Bumgarner in 1928 in Denver, Oklahoma. His father was Weldon, a German American widower, and his mother was Mildred, who passed away when Garner was five. He was raised Methodist with his older brothers Jack and Charles. Following the end of World War II, Garner went to live with his father in Los Angeles, and attended Hollywood High School. Later, returning to Oklahoma, he enrolled at Norman High School, where he played basketball, football, and golf, and competed on the track team. During his senior year, he dropped out.</p><p>After having worked as a merchant mariner in the United States Merchant Marine, Garner enlisted in the California Army National Guard. He served his first seven months in California, and then went to Korea for 14 months as a rifleman with the 5th Regimental Combat Team. Among other honors, he was awarded a Korean Service Medal, a United Nations Service Medal for Korea, and a Purple Heart.</p><h2 id=career-beginnings-8220maverick8221><strong>Career Beginnings and "Maverick"</strong></h2><p>In 1954, Garner's friend Paul Gregory encouraged him to take a nonverbal part in the Broadway production of "The Caine Mutiny Court-Martial." Following this, Garner was cast in commercials and in larger television roles. Although he was passed over for the leading role on the Westerns series "Cheyenne," Garner still made an appearance on that show's 1955 pilot episode. The next year, he made his feature film debut in "The Girl He Left Behind" and "Toward the Unknown."</p><p>After appearing in "Sayonara" with <a href=# title="Marlon Brando Net Worth">Marlon Brando</a> in 1957, Garner had his breakthrough role playing professional gambler Bret Maverick on the ABC Western series "Maverick." A massive hit, the program beat both "The <a href=# title="Steve Allen Net Worth">Steve Allen</a> Show" and "The <a href=# title="Ed Sullivan Net Worth">Ed Sullivan</a> Show" in its time slot, and made Garner a household name. The series ran until 1962, and earned the actor an Emmy Award nomination.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-194078 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/James-Garner.jpg alt width=594 height=378 sizes="(max-width: 594px) 100vw, 594px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-194078 class=wp-caption-text>Mark Mainz/Getty Images</p><h2 id=1960s-on-film><strong>1960s on Film</strong></h2><p>Following a bitter departure from Warner Bros., Garner was hired by William Wyler to star in 1961's "The Children's Hour" with <a href=# title="Audrey Hepburn Net Worth">Audrey Hepburn</a> and <a href=# title="Shirley MacLaine Net Worth">Shirley MacLaine</a>.

Garner closed out the decade with "The Pink Jungle," the comedy Western "Support Your Local Sheriff!," and the detective drama "Marlowe," in which he played the titular private investigator.</p><h2 id=1970s-8220the-rockford-files8221><strong>1970s and "The Rockford Files"</strong></h2><p>Garner returned to television in 1971 to star in the offbeat Western series "Nichols."

They had one daughter, Greta, who is an author, artist, and philanthropist. In 1970, Garner and Clarke temporarily lived separately for three months; they separated again in 1979, before rejoining in 1981.</p><p>Garner struggled with health problems. Due to his physically strenuous work on "The Rockford Files," he underwent multiple knee operations. In 1988, he had quintuple bypass heart surgery, and in 2008, had surgery following a severe stroke. In 2014, Garner passed after suffering a heart attack brought on by coronary artery disease. He was 86.</p><h2 id=real-estate><strong>Real Estate</strong></h2><p>In 1966 James bought a newly constructed home in LA's Brentwood neighborhood.
