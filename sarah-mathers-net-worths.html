So, read the full article to know everything about Eminem’s sister.</span></p><h2>Sarah Mathers’ Net Worth</h2><p><span>As of yet, since Sarah Mathers stayed away from media attention until the revelation was made by her father, her net worth isn’t known whereas, her half-brother who is a popular rapper, the songwriter has had an extremely successful music career, and reportedly, he has an estimated net worth of nearly $230 million.</span></p><h3>Sarah Mathers Net Worth’s Early Life</h3><p><span>Sarah Mathers was born in San Diego, California in 1982. She is the child of Marshall Bruce Mathers Jr. and the name of her mother was never revealed. She also has one biological sibling, Michael Mathers. She also has a half-brother, Marshall Bruce Mathers III who is popular by his professional name, Eminem. Eminem had a tough childhood since he was abandoned by his father and mother both at just 6 months old as his father wanted to begin a new life with Sarah’s mother.</span></p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Emily Frlekin: Personal Life, Career, Marriage , and Net Worth</a></p><p><span>As a child, Eminem used to write a lot of letters to his father, but his father never responded to those letters which led to his developing a sense of hatred in Eminem for his father. He had also put down his father with his songs, judging him for leaving Eminem as a child.</span></p><p><span>The doubt about Eminem’s relationship with her started to grow while she was going to a family barbeque. During the time, Eminem’s show premiered, and that is when she began to think if he was her long-lost sibling. She says that she knew that she had a brother, but had no knowledge that Eminem would turn out as her brother. Eminem’s real name should have clicked her very early, but she couldn’t even guess that he would be her brother.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/venturejolt.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Sarah-Mathers-.jpg><p><span>As per Contact Music, Sarah Mathers could apparently clear her suspicions after she heard her father’s conversation with her aunt Edna, confirming that Eminem is her brother. In addition, she used to believe that her brother Michael looks like Eminem. Since then, she has caught media attention as Eminem’s long-lost sister.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>After she found out that Eminem is her brother, Sarah as well as her father made many attempts to contact Eminem; they also said that his father has been trying to reach out to Eminem for many years but could not succeed due to Eminem’s musical tours. Further, he added that he had no interest in his son’s fame or wealth and only wanted to know if his first son can accept him in his life again. Similarly, Sarah said that she also had no interest in Eminem’s wealth, and rather wanted to meet her real brother.</span></p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Cassandra Jade Estevez Net Worth, Family, Age, And All Latest Information</a></p><p><span>Though Eminem had other thoughts as his father never bothered to write him a letter. He said that his father wanted to contact him just after he gained popularity. He expressed his dissentient by adding that his father never sent anything to him, not even a single letter all those years. Sadly, his father died at the age of 67 after he suffered a heart attack. The siblings saw Eminem during a tour, but he didn’t seem interested in talking to them, which actually broke Sarah’s heart, and she stated that it was upsetting. Though she still says that she will not give up hope and wait until Eminem makes the next move.</span></p><h3>Sarah Mathers Net Worth’s Career</h3><p><span>Sarah Mathers is gaining media attention just because of her relationship with the extremely popular and beloved singer, Eminem and due to this, no information is available at all about her professional career. Though we do know that when she was 23 years old, she worked as a waitress. Besides this, no substantial evidence is there that reflects on her professional career. Sarah is also not active on any social media platforms, which made it even harder to know about her lifestyle and career.</span></p><p><b>Final Words</b></p><p><span>Well, this is all we know about Eminem’s half-sister.
