Growing up in the rock and roll era of music in 60s Liverpool, it's unsurprising that she was in close connection and working with The Beatles. John Lennon even introduced Cilla to Beatles manager Brian Epstein, who signed her in the early 60s and then subsequently introduced her to 'fifth member of the Beatles' George Martin. Cilla then released her first single three weeks later. Her second single, a Dionne Warwick cover, rose to number one in 1964 and spent three weeks at the top of the charts.</p><p id=eTk9xLlFTY0R data-wc=1><strong>MORE:&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>7 standout moments you have to see from the BRITs</a></strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/b00c6d286b93-paul-o-grady-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=eGVB2jNnswCv data-wc=9><strong>Cilla's close friend Paul O'Grady appears in the documentary</strong></p><p id=e8k7ZhSx2MXv data-wc=79>Following her early success in music, Cilla's career went from strength and strength.

By the mid-80s, Cilla was doing more TV presenting, including , which ran until 2003 and , perhaps her most well-known show, which ran until 2001.</p><h2>Cilla Black's later career and net worth</h2><p id=eA6jnyorGLFt data-wc=91>Cilla continued to work in music and television throughout the 90s and 2000s, appearing on shows such as , and . To celebrate 50 years in showbiz, ITV aired a one-off entertainment special in 2013. The show was called and was hosted by fellow TV presenter and close friend, Paul O'Grady, and featured special performances and tributes to the star. In 2014, Cilla was given the Special Award at the British Academy Television Awards.</p><p id=eGAyatrDdu4D data-wc=1><strong>MORE:&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>Is this major Doctor Who character leaving the show?</a></strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/6720568c8d70-cilla-the-lost-tapes-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=eDWmQJImuV7j data-wc=7><strong>Cilla Black had an incredibly successful career</strong></p><p id=ehn73SiOXlSy data-wc=49>After an incredible career in music, television and more, it's no wonder that Cilla's net worth reflects her success.
