Over those many years, millions and millions of people have sat in front of their televisions to see what Springfield’s favorite family is up to. There are certain episodes however, that have been seen by more people than others when they were first aired.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Many of these top ten most-watched episodes come from the show’s first season in 1990 when there weren’t as many viewing options out there. The last few years has seen the show’s audience decline steadily to a point where barely three or four million people are tuning in on a Sunday night for a new episode. Every single episode on this list had at least 27 million people watching. It could be a matter of viewing tendencies in this day and age with cable forcing its way into the habits of consumers but the golden days of network television have gone by the wayside.</p><p>Who knows how much longer the Simpson family will be entertaining us with various pranks on Moe or the occasional Flanders appearance, but it is still one of the most beloved shows on television today. Here are the top ten most watched episodes of The Simpsons.</p><h2 id=10-season-1-episode-3-homer-s-odyssey><strong>10. Season 1 Episode 3: Homer’s Odyssey&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Via basementrejects.com</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This episode was watched by 27.5 million people on Jan. 21, 1990 as Homer crashes an electric cart into a cooling vent and ends up getting fired. After getting fired, Homer feels that he let his family down and writes a suicide note. He decides to end his life by attempting to jump off a bridge with a boulder attached to him. Luckily, Lisa finds the note and alerts the family who hurries over. The family nearly gets run over by a truck and Homer saves them, giving him new reason to live. He would get his job back at the plant when Mr. Burns offers him a new position as safety inspector with a higher salary. It is definitely an episode that shows that life is worth living no matter how bad things get.</p><p></p><h2 id=9-season-1-episode-7-the-call-of-the-simpsons><strong>9. Season 1 Episode 7:&nbsp;</strong><strong>The Call of the Simpsons</strong></h2><p>Via simpsons.wikia.com</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>27.6 million people watched this episode on Feb. 18, 1990 as Homer decides he wants to buy an RV after becoming jealous of Flanders having one.

The episode begins with Homer and Bart being chased with the head in their hands as Bart recounts what happened the day before. In due time, Bart realizes what he did and confesses that he was responsible for severing the head. The admission brings Springfield closer together as they were fighting for the common cause of getting Bart for his actions. The head is returned to the statue and everyone ends up being forgiven.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=7-season-4-episode-10-lisa-s-first-word><strong>7.

Mr. Burns hires Karl as Homer's new secretary, who tells Homer that he is the finest creature ever created and that he deserves everything he has. Bart would drop the bottle in an attempt to grow a beard however, and Homer’s hair would soon be gone, moving him back to his dead end position.</p><p></p><h2 id=5-season-1-episode-10-homer-s-night-out><strong>5.

Bob warns criminals that children are smart and will find them as well.
