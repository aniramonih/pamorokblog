life.</p><p>In the interview - which racked up over 9 million <a href=#>YouTube</a> views in less than 24 hours - comedian and actor Williams spoke about many topics, including <a href=#>his beef</a> with fellow comedian <a href=#>Kevin Hart</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto

class=wp-block-heading>Quadirah Locus</h3><p>Quadirah Locus was the first wife of comedian Kat Williams.</p><p>The pair welcomed one child together during their relationship.</p><p>Locus had a number of children prior to her <a href=#>marriage</a> to Williams and it has been reported that Williams adopted these children, the half-brothers and sisters of his son.</p><p>Williams and Locus are now divorced.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE ON KATT WILLIAMS">READ MORE ON KATT WILLIAMS</h2><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Eboni Gray</h3><p>Williams was reportedly in a "legal union" with a woman named Eboni Gray following his <a href=#>divorce</a> from his first wife.</p><p>In 2016, <a href=# aria-label="TMZ reported (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">TMZ reported</a> that Gray had asked the <a href=#>courts</a> to annul her alleged domestic partnership with the comedian.</p><p>She claimed that "they were together, in the eyes of the <a href=#>law</a>, from 2010 to 2011", according to the publication.</p><p>Williams denied Gray's claims, saying there was no romantic involvement between the pair.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Entertainment</h2></p><p>Williams has had several other high-profile relationships, including romances with Jhonni Blaze, Arica Kane, Hazel-E and Maryse Selit.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Does Katt Williams have any children?</h2><p>Williams has eight children.</p><p>He is father to his biological son Micah, who he shares with ex-wife Quadirah Locus, and also has seven adopted kids.</p><p>Williams once <a href=# aria-label="told Howard Stern (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">told Howard Stern</a>&nbsp;that the reason he has adopted so many children is because of a promise he once made himself.</p><p>Before making it in big in <a href=#>comedy</a>, he vowed to help others as much as he could, which is now why he has so many kids in his life.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What is Katt Williams' net worth?</h2><p>According to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Celebrity Net Worth</a>, Williams has a net worth of around&nbsp;$2million.</p><p>Williams has, however, claimed that his fortune is much larger.</p><p>In his January 2024 interview with&nbsp;<a href=#>Shannon Sharpe</a>, Williams claimed that he made almost $10million just from his 2022&nbsp;<a href=#>Netflix</a>&nbsp;comedy special <a href=#>World War III</a>.</p><p>He also said that he can earn over $100,000 for every comedy show he performs, suggesting he has a lot more than $2million in the bank.</p><p>Williams got his start in comedy after moving to&nbsp;<a href=#>Los Angeles</a>&nbsp;in 1999.</p><p>The star, who hitchhiked to&nbsp;<a href=#>Florida</a>&nbsp;after becoming emancipated from his parents at the age of 13, performed at comedy clubs like The Improv and Ice House in his early career.</p><p>He then then landed his first comedy special, Let a Playa Play, in 2006 and this was shortly followed up by another special on&nbsp;<a href=#>HBO</a>, The Pimp Chronicles Pt. 1.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What movies has Katt Williams starred in?</h2><p>Williams' first movie role was in 2002's Friday After Next, which he starred in with <a href=#>Ice Cube</a> and <a href=#>Mike Epps</a>.</p><p>His other credits include Epic Movie, Norbit, Scary Movie 5 and School Dance.</p><p>He has also appeared in many <a href=#>TV</a> shows throughout his career, including My Wife and Kids, Atlanta, Girlfriends and Black-ish.</p><p>In 2018 he won a&nbsp;Primetime&nbsp;<a href=#>Emmy Award</a>&nbsp;for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series for his role in Donald Glover's Atlanta.</p><p>Williams hit the headlines in January 2024 thanks to claims he made on Sharpe's podcast Club Shay Shay.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>In the interview, the star <a href=#>blasted his fellow comics</a>, including Cedric the Entertainer,&nbsp;<a href=#>Steve Harvey</a>, and Rickey Smiley.</p><p>Some fans were shocked by the statements Williams made in the nearly three-hour-long interview, but many also offered their support for the star on&nbsp;<a href=#>social media</a>.</p><p class=postsid
