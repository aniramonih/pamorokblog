Netflix in its series in detail covers the events including KWTX News reporter John McLemore and his team’s recorded footage of the raid.</p><p>So, in the rest of the writing, we shall discuss who John is and what he has been up to since being tipped off in time to cover one of the worst firefights in its history.</p><h3><strong>John McLemore On Netflix’s Waco: American Apocalypse</strong></h3><p>So, this is how John McLemore tells his perception of the American Apocalypse&nbsp;on the Netflix series.</p><p>At the time of the ATF raid, John McLemore was working as an investigative reporter and sports anchor for KWTX-TV in Waco, Texas. He was a pretty sought-after journalist and had notably covered the trial of the serial killer Kenneth McDuff just days before the raid happened. So, at this point, John was looking forward to a quiet weekend at home when his cameraman, Dan Mulloney, called him on the day of 28 February 1993 and informed him about the ATF operation that was about to transpire. Soon after, he and Dan drove down to the Mount Carmel Center compound outside Waco. The firing began of course and the situation soon escalated into a full-scale firefight.</p><p>John and Dan meanwhile focused entirely on the action for the entire raid. At last, when both sides called a ceasefire after 4 federal agents and 5 Branch Davidians were killed in it. John and his cameraman also helped transport some of the wounded in their car and were able to get the entire footage out to the station safely.</p><p>In the days that followed, John became kind of a celebrity. As an authentic eyewitness, he was invited to talk on several shows and was even nominated for an Emmy Award. But, that was short-lived as some news channels started to falsely accuse him of alerting the Branch Davidians about the raid. People thus began to hold him responsible as an accomplice for the murder of the federal agents. Things only got worse as he also lost his job, and there were none willing to recruit him.</p><p>Fast forward to 2018, when TexasMonthly reached out to him, he continued to remain wary of the rumors and false accusations that dogged him for the past 25 years. Yet, he said, he has no regrets.</p><h3><strong>Where Is John McLemore Today?</strong></h3><p>On 23 March 2023, we saw John McLemore explain to his people on Facebook that for the past two years, he had been working with Netflix to make the documentary. Hopeful that everyone is going to watch him on it, he promised that the project flashes some bunch of never before seen videos.</p><p>At the time of this writing, John continued to be the owner and operator of his own company, McLemore P.R. Consulting L.L.C. He started it in August 2014. Since then, he has been providing strategic guidance to other organizations regarding public or governmental affairs. He also seemed to have built up quite a reputation in the field.</p><h3><strong>John McLemore Age</strong></h3><p>As ‘John Lindsey Mclemore’, baby John was born in 1963. So, he turned 59 years old in 2022.</p><h3><strong>John McLemore Career</strong></h3><p>John McLemore had been working as an investigative reporter and sports anchor at KWTX-TV (CBS)&nbsp;since May 1987 and in between, he also completed his master’s degree in Rhetoric and Communications from Baylor University.</p><p>Afterward, from 1995 through 1997, he was a Press Secretary for the U.S. Congressional Race in Texas District 11.</p><p>Another four years, he spend as a director of corporate communications at Life Partners, Inc. For another 12 years and plus, beginning from August 2001, he was the senior advisor for global public affairs and crisis communications at<br>ConocoPhillips. Only then the McLemore P.R. Consulting&nbsp;happened.</p><h3><strong>Does John McLemore Have A Wife?</strong></h3><p>John McLemore did not seem to have a wife in his life as of 2023. In fact, on his Facebook, he admitted to being ‘single’.</p><p>Back in the day though John certainly had a wife, who worked as a receptionist at a bank. About her, John told in his interview with TexasMonthly how in the days that followed after the end of the siege, his family felt unwelcome in Waco, with his wife, getting hounded at work by those who held him partially responsible for the Branch Davidian tragedy.</p><p>In this marriage, John and his wife also welcomed one adorable daughter in 1995. Over the years, John has continuously shown on social media glimpses of his daughter growing into a fine beautiful lady.</p><p>John also once had a high school girlfriend with the name Kerry Muhlig.</p><h3><strong>John McLemore Family</strong></h3><p>Other than a very supportive sister-in-law called Jo McLemore, John has more than once mentioned his brother Jeff Mclemore. On his social media, Cibolo, Texas dwelling Jeff mentioned working at the United States Air Force Academy. He and Jo, who we mentioned earlier, are married. Also, so you know, Jeff with the full name ‘Jeffrey S Mclemore’ turned 56 years old in April 2022.</p><h3><strong>Related FAQs</strong></h3><ul><li><h4><strong>Where Is John McLemore From?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>John is likely a Waco, Texas born and bred.

On his Facebook, John only mentioned his move to Beijing, China which happen back in 2011, and the one to Doha, Qatar which happened even earlier, in 2005.<br>Moved in 2005.</p><p>As of March 2023 though, he seemed to be based in Houston, Texas.</p><ul><li><h4><strong>When Is John McLemore’s Birthday?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>John McLemore’s birthday is on November 25th.
