Up until last year, I liked Tori and admired her work ethic. She made something out of herself beyond being “Aaron Spelling’s daughter.” Maybe reality television isn’t everyone’s cuppa, but Tori carved out a respectable career of her own and sold a few bestselling books to supplement her earnings.</p><p>Then came the show cancellations, and Tori grew desperate. She and Dean McDermott spent so much money on real estate and luxury vacations that they <a href=#>couldn’t afford his vasectomy</a>. Dean may have cheated on Tori, but I don’t see him as some huge ladies’ man. The tabloids (read: Tori’s camp) would have us believe that Dean is a <a href=#>sex addict who has cheated for years</a>. Big Bad Dean has accused Tori of <a href=#>caring about their children more than sex</a>, but who could blame her? Given that Dean is a big cheater, it’s easy to believe that Tori might be <a href=#>repulsed by the mere thought</a> of doing her husband. (Celebrities … <a href=#>they’re just like us!</a>)</p><p>What I’m trying to say is this — all of the drama in Tori and Dean’s marriage could be for show, but Dean has completed his “rehab” stint. Us Weekly has <a href=#>exclusive photos</a> of Dean returning to the marital home and carrying car seats around like a good man. Radar Online adds a new wrinkle to the equation — Dean thinks Tori needs rehab too. Rehab for her spending habits. Is that a thing?</p><p>Dean McDermott was spotted for the first time on Monday outside of his family’s Los Angeles home, exactly 30 days after he checked into rehab for the “mistakes” he made, the “pain” he’d caused his loves ones and so that he could “become the husband and father my family deserves.”</p><p>His first port of call, RadarOnline.com has learned: The father-of-five has told his wife Tori Spelling that she needs to seek help for her out of control spending!</p><p>Revealed a source: “Dean has told Tori she needs to get treatment for her spending, which is putting added pressure on the family. Tori’s spending is out of control… She will go through periods when it’s not an issue, but then she slips and buys stuff the family simply doesn’t need.</p><p>“There are nights that Dean doesn’t sleep because he is so concerned about how they are going to pay the bills. Tori is willing to get help, but complains she doesn’t have time because of their four kids.”</p><p>As Radar previously reported, Spelling and McDermott’s seven-year marriage was rocked by allegations that McDermott cheated with a woman named Emily Goodhand, who had claimed she had sex with the actor during a two-day romp at the Fairmont Royal York Hotel in Toronto.</p><p>Spelling confided to pals that if she were to divorce love rat Dean, she would go broke.</p><p>Said another insider: “She would definitely kick Dean to the curb if she could financially afford to do so… Tori has admitted she would file for divorce from Dean, but she is afraid she would go broke.</p><p>“The couple has no prenuptial agreement and Tori is the sole breadwinner. Dean wouldn’t settle for anything less than joint custody and Tori would be forced to pay him spousal and child support. It’s a really sad situation for Tori and the kids.”</p><p>Spelling, 40, has a net worth that has been the subject of much debate with some reports placing it as high as $300 million, while others have suggested she is broke and the treasure chest has evaporated to as low as $1.5 million.</p><p>[From <a href=#>Radar Online</a>]</p><p>Ha. This fits the storyline just perfectly, doesn’t it? We can choose to believe that Dean’s recovery leads to a natural progression where Tori is pushed to confront her own addictions. OR we can believe that Dean is an entitled tool that thinks he’s so much better than Tori now that he’s gotten “help.” Mind you, this is help that <a href=#>Tori has paid for</a> Dean to receive.</p><p>Just for kicks, here’s a new picture of a rental truck outside of the new $10,000 per month rental home where Tori has been living with her four children. The truck presumably contains Dean’s belongings. The home has six bedrooms, seven bathrooms, a couple of living rooms, and an in-ground swimming pool. It seems a little excessive for a couple with money problems, right?</p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/113529CHP_Spelling23.jpg alt="Tori Spelling" width=550 sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>Photos courtesy of Pacific Coast News & WENN</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmirJOdxm%2BvzqZmbG1iZX90e8OemKeXnZixpr7MqKutl6SkuaWr06ipopejpbKtuMinnpirmJqsr7HEnaqYqpWdrqOr06imaA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fdean-mcdermott-told-tori-spelling-she-needs-rehab-too.html&text=Dean%20McDermott%20told%20Tori%20Spelling%20she%20needs%20rehab%20for%20her%20spending%20habits&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdean-mcdermott-told-tori-spelling-she-needs-rehab-too.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdean-mcdermott-told-tori-spelling-she-needs-rehab-too.html&title=Dean%20McDermott%20told%20Tori%20Spelling%20she%20needs%20rehab%20for%20her%20spending%20habits" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fdean-mcdermott-told-tori-spelling-she-needs-rehab-too.html&title=Dean%20McDermott%20told%20Tori%20Spelling%20she%20needs%20rehab%20for%20her%20spending%20habits" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fdean-mcdermott-told-tori-spelling-she-needs-rehab-too.html&title=Dean%20McDermott%20told%20Tori%20Spelling%20she%20needs%20rehab%20for%20her%20spending%20habits" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdean-mcdermott-told-tori-spelling-she-needs-rehab-too.html&description=Dean%20McDermott%20told%20Tori%20Spelling%20she%20needs%20rehab%20for%20her%20spending%20habits" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./did-stephanie-grisham-ever-undergone-plastic-surgery-rumors-reason-explained.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Did Stephanie Grisham Ever Undergone Plastic Surgery?
