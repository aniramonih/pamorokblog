Lovable Nebraskan Sam Larson, who debuted on the show in its inaugural season (and was the runner-up back then), was the Alone Season 5 winner, after lasting <b>60 full days</b> in the Mongolian cold. Congratulations to him!</p><p>Secondly, Is Alone staged?</p><p>While a lot of shows, like Alaskan Bush People, have been outed as being almost entirely scripted, Alone really seems to lean into its premise. That’s because all of the contestants are very much alone. … Well, like the OG survivalist program, Alone participants <b>are recording all of their own footage</b>.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Has_anyone_on_Alone_died></span><strong>Has anyone on Alone died?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p><b>No contestant on Alone has died till now</b>.
